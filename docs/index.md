This is my personal [digital garden](digital_garden.md) where I share everything
I learn about a huge variety of topics, from [antifascism](antifascism.md)
and other forms of [activism](diversity.md), to [life
management](life_automation.md), [health](sleep.md), [Python](python.md),
[DevOps](devops.md), [software architecture](adr.md), [writing](writing.md),
[dancing](rave_dances.md), or [data analysis](recommender_systems.md).

Unlike in common blogging where you write an article and forget about it, posts
are treated as plants in various stages of growth and nurturing. Some might
wither and die, and others will flourish and provide a source of continued
knowledge for the gardener and folks in the community that visit.

# Visiting the garden

If this is your first visit, welcome!, you may be overwhelmed by the amount of
content and don't know where to start reading. Start with the first article that
grabs your attention of the navigation tree on the left and be ready to follow
the internal links to read the rest.

# Make your own digital garden

Don't be afraid to [create one of your own](build_your_own_wiki.md) and share
what you know with the world. Or [contribute](#contributing) to existing ones,
I would love to see the blue-book maintained by other people too.

If you don't want to start from scratch, you can [fork the blue
book](forking_this_wiki.md) and start writing straight away.

You can view [other similar gardens](digital_garden.md#existing-digital-gardens)
to get inspiration.
