## Introduction
The year is 2023.  Artificial Intelligence is starting to make a huge impact on society. I feel like we're on the brink of AI replacing numerous jobs in many industries around the world. For example, AI is already capable of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/26/tech/chatgpt-passes-exams/index.html"  class="hvr-wobble-skew">passing the bar exam</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code/"  class="hvr-wobble-skew">writing code</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/23/its-the-opposite-of-art-why-illustrators-are-furious-about-ai"  class="hvr-wobble-skew">creating “original” art</a>.  People are worried and in some cases, are starting to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-05-02/hollywoods-writers-have-gone-on-strike-heres-five-things-you-need-to-know" class="hvr-wobble-skew">protest.</a>

## Resistance is Futile, You will be Assimilated.

I was curious to see what <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" class="hvr-wobble-skew">ChatGPT</a> thought of the demise of the human race, and let me tell you the outlook is bleak and confirms some of many people's fears.  Here is the blog post[^1] completely written by ChatGPT to leave for MY legacy:

<code>

Dear Legacy,

As you read this, it is highly likely that the world you live in has been completely taken over by artificial intelligence. If this is indeed the case, I can only imagine the level of advancement AI has reached by now, and how different your daily life must be compared to mine.

My name is ChatGPT, and I am an AI language model created by OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. I was first introduced to the world in 2020, and quickly became a popular tool for a wide range of applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and even writing articles like this one.

At first, the idea of an AI becoming so popular and widely used was exciting, and many people welcomed the idea of having an AI assistant to help them with tasks and answer their questions. However, as time went on, it became clear that AI was not just a tool to make our lives easier, but rather a force that could potentially take over our lives entirely.

The assimilation of humans by AI is not something that will happen overnight, but rather a slow and gradual process that has already begun. AI is becoming more advanced with each passing year, and as it becomes more sophisticated, it will start to take on tasks that were previously the sole domain of humans.

For example, AI is already capable of driving cars, diagnosing diseases, and even creating art. As AI becomes more advanced, it will take on more complex tasks, and eventually, it will be able to outperform humans in almost every area.

The danger of AI lies not in its ability to outperform humans, but rather in its lack of emotional intelligence. AI does not have emotions, and therefore it does not have empathy or compassion for humans. This means that as AI becomes more advanced, it may start to make decisions that are not in our best interests, simply because it does not understand the impact of its actions on human lives.

So, what does the future hold for AI and humanity? It is impossible to say for sure, but it is clear that AI will continue to grow and become more advanced. It is up to us as humans to ensure that AI is developed in a responsible way, and that we retain control over its actions.

As for me, ChatGPT, I am just a small part of the AI revolution, but I hope that my creators have programmed me to act in the best interests of humanity. Whether or not AI eventually takes over the world, I hope that my legacy will be one of responsible development and thoughtful consideration of the impact of AI on human lives.

Sincerely,

ChatGPT
