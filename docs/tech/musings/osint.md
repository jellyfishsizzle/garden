## What is OSINT?

OSINT stands for open source intelligence.  Basically, any information that can *legally* be gathered from free, public sources about an individual or organization. Usually, that means information found on the internet.  Technically anything that is public information falls into the category of OSINT. 

Think about that for a minute.  It's not just books or reports in a public library, it's also articles in a newspaper, or statements in a press release.  Obituaries, social media accounts (and the associated posts), all your data is out there for anyone to see.

You're probably thinking, "So what?  I don't have to worry about anything like that."
A lot of people these days don't, but what about these:

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Instagram
- Reddit
- Other various online forums

## Why should I care?
- Identity theft
- Password/creds theft
- Stalking/physical location

## What do I do now?
It's never too late!  Here are a few things you can do with very little effort to protect yourself from common forms of identity theft:

**Put a freeze on your credit for the big three credit organizations:**

- Equifax
- Transunion
- Experian  

Unless you are someone that frequently requires having your credit history checked (like buying cars or getting new credit cards), it's pretty much a set it and forget it type thing.  On the rare occasion, you need to have your credit checked, it's just a matter of flipping the switch on their app or website.  

A little bit of time and effort now beats the potential sadness and hassle later down the road.
