## What is OSINT?

OSINT stands for open source intelligence.  Basically, any information that can *legally* be gathered from free, public sources about an individual or organization. Usually, that means information found on the internet.  Technically anything that is public information falls into the category of OSINT. 

Think about that for a minute.  It's not just books or reports in a public library, it's also articles in a newspaper, or statements in a press release.  

You're probably thinking, "So what?  I don't have to worry about anything like that."
A lot of people these days don't, but what about these:

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Instagram
- Reddit
- Other various online forums

## Why should I care?
- Identity theft
- Password/creds theft
- Stalking/physical location

## What do I do now?
It's never too late!  Here are a few things you can do with very little effort to protect yourself from common forms of identity theft:

**Put a freeze on your credit for the big three credit organizations:**

- Equifax
- Transunion
- Experian  

Unless you are someone that frequently requires having your credit history checked (like buying cars or getting new credit cards), it's pretty much a set it and forget it type thing.  On the rare occasion, you need to have your credit checked, it's just a matter of flipping the switch on their app or website.  A little bit of time and effort now beats the potential sadness and hassle later down the road.

**Use a password manager like 1password or onepass**
   
Personally, I use 1Password and yes, I use the cloud version.  I'm probably going to against some people's opinions and say your passwords or credit card numbers are far more secure in their encrypted storage that is also encrypted end to end than keeping it locally.  But I think at some point, you HAVE to trust someone with your important data, especially passwords.  

I currently have 378 passwords and secure notes in my account.  There is no possible way I could remember every single one unless I just used the same one everywhere.  

## Why is it bad to have a weak password?

Obviously, using the same password for everything is a very dangerous thing to do.  You're probably thinking, "I don't care if someone finds my Netflix account, nobody cares what I'm watching." 

But what if [Netflix was compromised](https://firewalltimes.com/netflix-data-breach-timeline/)? Think about the things that Netflix knows about you..

- Username
- Password
- Credit Card
- Programming choices
- Email address
- Home/billing address

Now, what could someone do with THIS data?  Would any of these things be used by your other accounts like Amazon or bank account or other financial accounts?  You have to think like a hacker.  If your Netflix data (that is now PUBLIC) contains the name of a pet or a relative, maybe they could guess other bits of data.  

For example, if my compromised Netflix password is scruffy89 and maybe my Amazon account password is also the same, then they would have complete control of your Amazon account including purchase history and a LOT more personal data.  

Well, my password isn't EXACTLY the same, I increment the number at the end! Even still it would only take a few guesses if it was scruffy88 or scruffy95. Worse yet, if it were scruffy1995, it'd be easy to guess 1995 was a significant year.  Could it be part of your other passwords or maybe even a security code for something else?  See where this can go? All because someone at Netflix made a mistake.  Right?  Well..

In some cases, it's not directly the fault of the company that is supposed to be protecting your data, it could be a third party or contractor.  Regardless of who is to blame, this day and age there are a lot more people that have access to your data than you realize.  Keep it safe!
