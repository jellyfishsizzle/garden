## Introduction

Just got a new (to me) <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/" class="hvr-wobble-skew">Erogodox EZ</a> and it's got a bit of a learning curve.  What better way to get the hang of it than to just start typing?  I figured I need some practice anyway and I've been working on trying to keep better notes of things while I do them, this seemed perfect.  I borrowed this keyboard from a co-worker and after a little test drive, I think I'm going to enjoy this one.  I love how clicky these brown switches are.

I currently use a <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/" class="hvr-wobble-skew">Kenisis Advantage</a> that work was nice enough to buy for me.  I’ve used it for over 15 years and I love it but wanted to try the Ergodox also.   It has the same steep learning curve so I was hoping it was like riding a bike.  So far it’s been a little tricky but I’m enjoying it.  Did I mention it’s also really clicky?

## Setup

Setting it up is pretty straightforward:

1. Plug in all the things
2. Confirm layout 
3. Customize keyboard as needed by visiting <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/default/latest/0" class="hvr-wobble-skew">Oryx</a>
4. If changing the layout, we need to download <a href="https://www.zsa.io/wally/" class="hvr-wobble-skew">Wally</a> to flash the firmware 
5. Open Wally and drag the compiled layout from Step \#3
6. Reset the keyboard with a paperclip to the top right corner
7. Follow on-screen directions for identifying the keyboard

Now to figure out how the tenting should be…

## Final words

After 24 hours I gave it back.  I really liked it, but switching between ortholinear keyboards was too difficult.  Also, I need brown switches now.
