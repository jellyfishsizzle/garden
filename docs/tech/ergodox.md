## Introduction
Just got a new (to me) [Erogodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) and it's got a bit of a learning curve.  What better way to get the hang of it than to just start typing?  I figured I need some practice anyway and I've been working on trying to keep better notes of things while I do them, this seemed perfect.  I borrowed this keyboard from a co-worker and after a little test drive, I think I'm going to enjoy this one.  I love how clicky these brown switches are.

I currently use a [Kenisis Advantage](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/) that work was nice enough to buy for me.  I’ve used it for over 15 years and I love it but wanted to try the Ergodox also.   It has the same steep learning curve so I was hoping it was like riding a bike.  So far it’s been a little tricky but I’m enjoying it.  Did I mention it’s also really clicky?

## Setup
Setting it up is pretty straightforward:

1. Plug in all the things
2. Confirm layout 
3. Customize keyboard as needed by visiting [Oryx](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/default/latest/0)
4. If changing the layout, we need to download [Wally](https://www.zsa.io/wally/) to flash the firmware 
5. Open Wally and drag the compiled layout from Step \#3
6. Reset the keyboard with a paperclip to the top right corner
7. Follow on-screen directions for identifying the keyboard

Now to figure out how the tenting should be…

## Final words
After 24 hours I gave it back.  I really liked it, but switching between ortholinear keyboards was too difficult.
