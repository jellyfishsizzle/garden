Jailbreak with Checkra1n (semi-untethered)

1. Connect device via lightning cable
2. Run checkra1n app on local machine
3. Ensure iOS device is found 
4. Click start
5. Enter DFU mode
  
      - Simultaneously press and hold the power button and the Home button until the screen turns black.
      - Three seconds after the screen turns black, release the power button, but keep holding the Home button.
      - Repeat until you enter DFU mode. I found having my fingers on both buttons and using my knuckle to start the countdown worked.  Timing for releasing the home button is critical.

Currently running iOS 12.5.4 on my iPad Mini 2 and it's perfect for when I don't want to use my laptop.
