###  Introduction
```
wan·der·lust
/ˈwändərˌləst/

noun
a strong desire to travel.
"a man consumed by wanderlust"
```

I absolutely love to travel.  I joined the Navy to "see the world" and while I didn't travel quite as much as I hoped[^1], it was a huge change from growing up in the 'burbs. But it came in handy when I met the love of my life and I wasn't out to sea on 6 month long deployments.  Plus, I did get to see much more than I might have had I not joined the Navy.  As I've gotten older, I've been lucky enough to have a steady career that allows me to take time off to rejuvenate and travel with my family.

Now, I try to take advantage of any opportunity or excuse to travel somewhere or at the very least take a road trip.  When I first met my wife, we lived in a shitty little apartment with shitty roommates and so we were home as little as possible.  Sometimes we would just jump in the car, pick a direction and go.  We would drive until we felt like we were "there".

The last two years of Covid made traveling difficult.  Because of [lockdowns](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/us/california-stay-at-home-order.html), Covid [variants](https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/information/covid-19-variants), and so much of the country in disarray from [fires](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/california-wildfire-lake-tahoe-half-contained-79881492), [flooding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33786171/), [tornadoes](https://www.noaa.gov/news/december-2021-tornado-outbreak-explained) the effects of the last two years made it that even if we weren't afraid of dying of Covid and didn't care about a very real possibility of [World War III](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-warning-world-war-three-lavrov-1700897), a lot of things are either not fully staffed, or just not operating at 100%.

We took a (very) few trips during the first two years of the pandemic and the time between 1/22 and 5/22 included pretty much zero travel farther than random trips down the coast.  I’m READY to GTFO!

Hopefully, this area of my <a href="/" class="hvr-wobble-skew">garden</a> will grow the fastest! :)
