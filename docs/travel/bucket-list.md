I don't really have a "bucket list" because there are so many things to see and so little time.  A bucket list also usually includes ALL the things you want to do and experience.  This is going to be just reserved for travel.  Here are a few of the places at the top of the list I'd like to see, in no particular order.  Obviously, this is a work in progress.

* Egypt (Pyramids of Giza and Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa)
* The Great Wall of China
* An African Safari (Tansania?)
* Northern Lights (Alaska?)
* Victoria Falls (Border of Zambia and Zimbabwe)
* Machu Picchu
* The Maldives
* Louvre
* Santorini, Greece
* Dubai
* Angkor Wat
* Azerbaijan
* Gal√°pagos Islands
* Mt Rushmore
* The Acropolis
* Petra, Jordan
* Borobudur Templem, Indonesia
* Forbidden City, China
* Jellyfish Lake (Danau Ubur), Palau
* Seychelles 
* Madagascar 
* Patagonia
* World cruise
