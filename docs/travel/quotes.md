These quotes were initially going to be the majority of the travel section [README](/travel/), but the list keeps growing.  I've tried to personalize this a bit by adding my own comments and feelings I associate with these quotes. 

* "If the road you travel has no obstacles, it leads nowhere." -Frank A. Clark

> This is true.  While people always hope for a trip without problems or obstacles, those are the ones that are most memorable.  Just remember (in most cases) obstacles generally result in the best stories.

*  “You have brains in your head. Feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You’re on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who’ll decide where to go…” – Dr. Seuss
  
> I love the feeling of being in a new place and exploring all the new wonders. The only thing stopping me is me.

* “Traveling – it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.” – Ibn Battuta

> This is how I hope every trip goes.  There is so much beauty to see and the only thing better than seeing it is sharing it with other people.  

* "There is no bad weather, only inappropriate clothing." - Alfred Wainwright

> These are words I’m trying to embrace more and more.  If you dress for the environment you intend to be in, the weather shouldn’t be an issue.  I have been inside ice caves in Iceland and because I was completely prepared, I had a great time with my family.

* “The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.” – Saint Augustine

> I have encountered people that never left their hometowns despite being 30 minutes to the country’s borders.  I once met someone who couldn’t understand why I would be interested in traveling and I just couldn’t wrap my brain around that.  Who wouldn’t want to see the rest of the world? 

* “Better to see something once than hear about it a thousand times.” – Asian Proverb

> I never fully understood this until I visited the Colosseum in Rome.  We stayed at a hotel right nearby, however, we didn’t know how nearby.  After dropping our things off at the hotel, we went for a walk to find dinner.  Just wandering around without any direction, we turned a corner and unexpectedly saw the Colosseum in all it’s beauty.  I will forever remember that feeling and how it measured up to the photos I had seen previously.
