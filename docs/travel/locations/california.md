I have spent a lot of time in California and, as such, I have a list of my fav places around the state.  If someone said, "I have some time to visit, what things should I absolutely not miss?".  These are my recommendations in no particular order:

### Must-See Attractions
* Yosemite 
* Hwy 1 north from SF: Mendocino, Ft Bragg, Glass Beach
* Hwy 1 south from SF: bixby bridge, Monterey, Carmel 
* Madonna Inn[^1]
* Old Town Sacramento
* Desert: Joshua Tree, Mojave, Death Valley
* Beaches: Huntington Beach, Santa Cruz, Laguna Beach 
* Muir Woods, Sequoia, or Ave of Giants 
* Fern Canyon
* California Missions
