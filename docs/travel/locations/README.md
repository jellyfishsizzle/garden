These are locations that I have already visited or lived nearby or have some opinions or insights that might be noteworthy.  

What defines having "been there" or visited?  I have driven through Slovania from East to West.  However, we only stopped for gas, bathroom, and food.  Does that count as a visit?  Debatable. I guess any definition of having been someplace really just depends on your point of view.  For me, I just know.
