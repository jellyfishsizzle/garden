You don't need to be high to enjoy Pink Floyd, you need Pink Floyd to enjoy being high.

The way to get into it is to start with Dark Side of the Moon and then Wish You Were Here.  Both albums are amazing.

Also, if you havenâ€™t seen it, check out [Dark Side of the Rainbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtExVJlgEC0).  It will blow your mind.
