## Introduction
Growing up as a product of [Gen X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X) ,[Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)) was the soundtrack to many events in my impressionable years.  I remember waiting to be "old enough" to watch [Purple Rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Rain_%28film%29).  [Sign o' the Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_o'_the_Times) came out when I was in high school and just cemented my love for the artist, after [Purple Rain \(album\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Rain_(album)). I attended dances where many of his hits played, and was even part of my life when I was in the [Navy](/life/in-the-navy/).  Prince is one of the few celeb deaths that really mattered to me.

## About 
Prince Rogers Nelson was Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Prince wrote his first song, "Funk Machine", on his father's piano when he was seven years old.  Then at 19 he signed a record deal with Warner Bros, soon releasing his first album, [For You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_You_(Prince_album)) in 1978.   He released album after album with hit after hit from there.

Sadly, Prince died in 2016 at the age of 57 from an accidental overdose of fentanyl.  The fentanyl that led to his overdose was contained in counterfeit pills made to look like a generic version of the painkiller [hydrocodone/paracetamol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocodone/paracetamol). The question of how and from what source Prince obtained the drug that led to his death has been the subject of investigations by several law enforcement agencies.

## Music
There are so many songs by Prince that I love, I couldn’t pick just one or even two or three songs that I would say is my favorite.

Recently I came across a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrwXzbX3SWnu1H2yesZA0-28anAKGK6ZE) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) that has 98 official music videos distributed by his estate. There are quite a few videos that I really like in this playlist.  Some of my picks are:

* [The Most Beautiful Girl In the World](https://youtube.com/FuXbKLiW1UI%3Fsi=L_13xNYBTEk6xeBr)

## Conclusion
I’m a big fan of Prince.  The list of songs above is just a glimpse of the talent he possessed.  Each song is so different with so many meanings and messages.  I only wish I could have seen him perform at Paisley Park in person before he passed.

He was one of the greatest musicians to have walked this earth.
