## Introduction
When I was in the <a href="/life/in-the-navy/" class="hvr-wobble-skew">Navy</a>, I specialized in communications.  I knew the phonetic alphabet and some morse code.  I tried to learn Semaphone but it's not as easy as it looks, you basically need to learn the signals in reverse so that you are facing the person you are trying to communicate with.

I've done various <a href="/tech/" class="hvr-wobble-skew">CTFs</a> where there was a clue in morse code or braille, so when I found this chart I figured it'd be good to hang on to.
