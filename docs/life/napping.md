## Introduction
I love napping.  I would nap every single day if I could.  I like to consider myself an "advanced" napper since I don't actually get paid for <a href="https://gigworker.com/get-paid-to-nap/" class="hvr-wobble-skew">napping professionally</a>.  If I were filling out a survey or online profile I would list napping as a <a href="/hobbies/" class="hvr-wobble-skew">hobby</a>.

## About Napping
Napping has been a part of human culture for centuries. Many people have recognized the benefits of taking a midday snooze from ancient Greeks and Romans to modern-day cultures. In recent years, science has started to catch up, and research has shown that napping can have numerous benefits for our health and productivity. Let's look at some reasons why napping is healthy and highlight some famous people known for napping.

First, we should examine the benefits of napping. Studies have shown that napping can help improve cognitive function, memory, and creativity. <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/can-a-nap-boost-brain-health" class="hvr-wobble-skew">One study</a> found that people who took a 90-minute nap performed better on a memory test than those who didn't nap. Napping can also boost productivity and alertness, helping us power through the rest of our day with renewed energy. Additionally, napping has been shown to reduce stress, which can have positive effects on both our mental and physical health.

## Nap Tips
But how long should we nap for? According to the <a href="https://www.thensf.org/" class="hvr-wobble-skew">National Sleep Foundation</a>, a 20-30 minute nap can provide a quick boost of alertness and improve cognitive performance.  This is key, napping for too long can lead to grogginess and interfere with nighttime sleep.  45 minutes is my cutoff and I need to be done napping by 3pm.

## Famous Nappers
Now let's look at some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/27/from-aristotle-to-einstein-a-brief-history-of-power-nappers/" class="hvr-wobble-skew">famous people</a> who are known for napping. Winston Churchill was known to take a nap every afternoon, claiming that it helped him stay alert during the long hours he spent working. 

Salvador Dali also believed in the power of napping and would often take a nap while holding a key in his hand, which would fall and wake him up when he entered the dream state. Leonardo da Vinci was also a fan of napping and would reportedly take several short naps throughout the day.

More recent examples of famous nappers include Bill Clinton, who famously napped during the day to help him recharge and stay alert during his long work hours. Elon Musk is another high-profile napper, claiming to take short naps whenever he can to help him stay productive and focused on his work.

## Conclusion

Short naps can improve cognitive function, while longer naps can provide a full sleep cycle and improve memory consolidation and creativity. Many famous people throughout history have recognized the benefits of napping and incorporated it into their daily routine. 

So, the next time you feel the need for a nap, don't feel guilty â€“ it could be just what you need to power through the rest of your day.
