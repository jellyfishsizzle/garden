## Introduction

Back in the day, I was in the [Navy](./navy.md).  I served on two ships and two shore duty stations.  Some times were better than others, but I have no regrets and would absolutely do it again.  

However, there were definitely times when I was not a happy camper for one reason or another.  I made a list of reasons to get out when I was contemplating orders and whether I should stay in.  I recently came across the list I made, written by hand on paper, and decided to scan it and put it here.  

Keep in mind I was probably 17 or 18 when I started this list.  Apologies to ET1 Lian whom I don’t totally remember, but based on the list we didn’t really get along.  It seems I was also disappointed quite often about lack of cereal options.
