Really, there are questions that need to be answered. I suspect I'm going to have to put things in categories at some point or it will get out of hand quickly.  This is a work in progress.

***

<p class="accordion">Q00. Why does this FAQ require you to hit refresh again to see the answers?</p>
<div class="panel">Because I don't know enough JavaScript to fix it. I already spent way too long on getting the look I had in mind, so I'm not ready to abandon it just yet. Don't worry, I'll get around to it in all my copious spare time™.  In the meantime, both visitors to this garden will have to refresh the page twice before the answers will be visible. This is probably the most first-world problem I can think of. If this bothers anyone you can file a ticket with our support team.<sup>1</sup></div> 

<p class="accordion">Q01. Do you really need an FAQ page?</p>
<div class="panel" id="Q01">No, but I love FAQs!  Also, the <a href="/">Introduction</a> doesn't cover everything.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q02. Who are you?</p>
<div class="panel">I'm a security enthusiast, sysadmin, veteran, father, husband, tinkerer, and all around geek. A jack of all trades (and master of none).</div>

<p class="accordion">Q03. What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?</p>
<div class="panel">42.<sup>2<sup></div>

<p class="accordion">Q04. Don't you have anything better to do with your time?</p>
<div class="panel">What is a better use of my time other than giving my unwanted opinion?</div>

<p class="accordion">Q05. How often will there be a new post?</p>
<div class="panel">When the mood strikes me.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q06. How long should you wait to go into the water after you've eaten?</p>
<div class="panel">At least 30 minutes.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q07. What kind of music do you like?</p>
<div class="panel">Depends on my mood and who I'm with.  Pretty much anything but country.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q08. What's wrong with country music?</p>
<div class="panel">So many things. I've tried to like it and I've worked with people that
listen to nothing but country. It's just not my thing.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q09. Why is the sky blue?</p>
<div class="panel">Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions
by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more
than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q10. What is the definition of a will?</p>
<div class="panel" id="Q10">A dead giveaway.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q11. How much Red Bull can someone drink and not die?</p>
<div class="panel">According to <a href="https://www.caffeineinformer.com/death-by-caffeine">Caffiene Calculator</a> I can drink 170 cans and still be safe.  Although, I'd probably be pretty sick.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q12. Is there a map of the internet?</p>
<div class="panel">The Carna botnet was comprised of 420,000 devices created by an anonymous researcher to measure the extent of the Internet in what the creator called the “Internet Census of 2012”.  More details about how it went down and the resulting map can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carna_botnet">Wikipedia</a></div>

<p class="accordion">Q13. Cats or dogs?</p>
<div class="panel">Cats.<sup>3</sup></div>

<p class="accordion">Q14. Where is the best place to go for a vacation?</p>
<div class="panel">My current favorite destination is Japan.<sup>4</sup></div>

<p class="accordion">Q15. What time is it?</p>
<div class="panel">Check out the <a href="https://www.time.gov/">NIST Official Official Map.</a>  If you are outside the US, you're out of luck.  According to the page "The .gov means it’s official."</div>

<p class="accordion">Q16. If milk goes bad if not refrigerated, why does it not go bad inside the cow?</p>
<div class="panel">It won't go bad per se, but if a cow is not milked regularly, it can eventually stop production.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q17. Are you an expert on cows?</p>
<div class="panel">No.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q18. What about cats? </p>
<div class="panel">I like them, but not really an expert.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q19. Why is this place called "Cat Elevator"?</p>

<p class="accordion">Q20. I skipped the <a href="/">intro</a>, what is a digital garden?</p>
<div class="panel" id="Q20">For now, you'll have to rely on the intro. I might write more about it later™.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q21. How do I create my own digital garden? </p>
<div class="panel"><a href="https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/#make-your-own-digital-garden">This</a> is the place to start.  Alternatively, you can fork my repo and tinker.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q22. Who is the intended audience of your "garden"?</p>
<div class="panel">I am.  I was going to add more to that sentence but then realized, it's me. Then I realized, I need an <a href="/about">about</a> page.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q23. Why do you double space after a period?</p>
<div class="panel">I learned to type on a teletype machine in the Navy.  A teletype message had to have two spaces after a sentence for it to be clear enough to read.  Now it's just 30 years of muscle memory.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q24. Do you have a disclaimer? </p>
<div class="panel">Why, <a href="/about">yes</a> I do.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q25. Where is the chat feature? </p>
<div class="panel">This site is cobbled together in my spare time and hosted on GitHub. If you would like a chat feature, feel free to file a feature request with our support team<sup>5</sup>.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q26. Why don't footnote links work in the FAQ? </p>
<div class="panel">It's a markdown/html issue.  Trust me, it's easier this way, it's also more fun.<sup>6</sup></div>

<p class="accordion">Q27. How do you remove a file whose name starts with a '-'?".</p>
<div class="panel">"rm -filename" doesn't work, if you know enough about <a href="/tech/unix/getopts/">getopt()</a>, you can use "rm -- -filename".<sup>7</sup></div>

<p class="accordion">Q28. Why is the nav bar not in alphabetical order?</p>
<div class="panel">I have no idea.  I am pretty rigid when it comes to things like this, and I spent a good couple hours trying to figure out why it won't put things in alphabetical order and finally gave up for now.  It's definitely an <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org">mkdocs</a> thing.  I'm trying to embrace being less rigid, though and this is going to be one of those times where I am going to stop fighting it and see where it goes.  Does it really need to be a meticulously trimmed garden or can it wander?  For now I'm going to consider it a vine that grows in my <a href="/">garden</a> and sometimes it will grow to the directions it wants. </div>

<p class="accordion">Q29. What is the best distro of Linux?</p>
<div class="panel">The one *you* know best.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q30. Do you know how to pick locks?</p>
<div class="panel" id="Q30">Why yes, yes I do. At least, I know the basics<sup>7</sup> and have some of the equipment.  It's one of the <a href="/hobbies">hobbies</a> I've collected.</div>

<p class="accordion">Q31. Why do you share all this information in public?</p>
<div class="panel"></a>Aside from my feelings and opinions, I suspect most of my personal data has already been compromised as part of a breach somewhere.  As for the rest, I usually give opinions out for free, might as well have them all in one place.</div>
