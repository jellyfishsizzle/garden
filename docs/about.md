This page is a deeper dive into who my intended audience is. It's probably not very clear who this is for and that seems to vary from day to day.  Sometimes I want to have a big following and get feedback, whether it's upvotes or comments, or something similar.  However, I always want it to be for me.  I want this garden to be my operating manual for when I am either unable to remember something or when I am awakened after some kind of reboot.[^1]

I have a lot to say and nowhere to say it. Facebook steals your data and does terrible things with it. I went so far as to completely delete my account from Facebook back in 2017. I’m not a fan of Insta, Twitter, Snapchat, or pretty much any other social media. Reddit is my go-to for many things these days, but it’s not the appropriate place for a blog and I’m too lazy to have multiple accounts to keep things more anonymous there.

So here we are. Just a blank slate with plenty of space and lots of things I want to say. No “friends”, likes, dislikes, or funny captions.[^2] I might never allow comments, and I haven't decided who I will share this site's connection with me.  Maybe I'll keep it completely anonymous, but for now, it is what it is.
