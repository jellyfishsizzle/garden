This page is a deeper dive into who my intended audience is. It's probably not very clear who this is for and that seems to vary from day to day.  Sometimes I want to have a big following and get feedback, whether it's upvotes or comments, or something similar.  However, I always want it to be for me.  I want this garden to be my operating manual for when I am either unable to remember something or when I am awakened after some kind of reboot.[^1]

I have a lot to say and nowhere to say it. In fact, I dislike social media so much, I won't link to any of them from here. But I will still say Facebook[^4] steals your data and does [terrible things](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46618582) with it. I went so far as to completely delete my account from Facebook in 2017. I’m not a fan of Insta, Twitter[^5], Snapchat, or pretty much any other social media. Reddit ~is~[^6] was my go-to for many things these days, but it’s not the appropriate place for a blog and I’m too lazy to have multiple accounts to keep things more anonymous there. I've been giving [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/) (A federated Reddit alternative) a try, so far so good after about a month.

So here we are. Just a blank slate with plenty of space and lots of things I want to say. No “friends”, likes, dislikes, or funny captions.[^2] I might never allow comments, and I haven't decided who I will share this site's connection with me.  Maybe I'll keep it completely anonymous, but for now, it is what it is.

UPDATED: 2022-06-19.  I've decided for this to be live I need to start checking in updates instead of waiting for everything to be "just right".  This is for two reasons, firstly of all, it's always going to be a work in progress and secondly I'll have a change log of all the updates I've made.  It'll also make it easier to see the history of each file.  I know I can do it locally, but I feel like if I'm going to commit to this whole developing in public[^3].

[^6]: In July of 2023 Reddit decided it cared more about corporate greed than the users that made their community what it was.  The banned all 3rd party apps, regardless of userbase. In [protest](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) many subreddits went private and *many* users left the platform.
