## About
Seed Junkyâ€™s mouth-watering Ice Cream Gelato is an exotic Indica-dominant hybrid made by crossing Ice Cream Cake and Gelato 41. Ice Cream Gelato is a heavy yielder (for exotics) with grape-shaped buds that are potent. Recommended especially for indoor and greenhouse use, Gelato Ice Cream finishes flowering in about 9 weeks. This double-exotic cross produces forest green nugs covered with thick orange hairs and completely flushed with icy trichomes. The creamy flavor carries sweet nutty highlights and vanilla top notes, making it ideal for concentrate and flower connoisseurs.
