This is the strain README.

I currently reside where it's 100% legal.  During the lockdown of 2020, we decided to try growing our own.  I have to admit, I'm pretty lucky having an unlimited stock of marijuana.  

Since I like to grow and smoke cannabis I've started a journal of all the strains I come across and whether or not I liked them and also growing notes (in some cases). Not all of the descriptions are my own wording, but the results section is the effect it had on me. 

This list is comprised of strains I have tried and not just ones I've grown, so some required a little research (instead of straight from [Dark Heart Nursery](https://darkheartnursery.com/) where we usually purchase our clones).  Unless otherwise noted, the information for strains I DID NOT grow, comes from a combination of reviews found on [All Bud](https://www.allbud.com/marijuana-strains/indica-dominant-hybrid/point-break) and [Wikileaf](https://www.wikileaf.com/strain/point-break/).
