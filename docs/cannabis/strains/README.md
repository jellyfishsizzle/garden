This is the strain README.

I currently reside where it's 100% legal to possess and grow cannabis.  During the lockdown of 2020, we decided to try growing our own.  I have to admit, I'm pretty lucky having an unlimited stock of marijuana.  

Since I like to grow and smoke cannabis I've started a journal of all the strains I come across and whether or not I liked them, and in some cases growing notes. 

Not all of the descriptions are my own wording, but the results section is the effect it had on me. ~~Some~~ All  descriptions required a ~~little~~ lot of ~~research~~ plagiarism.  Most are straight from [Dark Heart Nursery](https://darkheartnursery.com/) where we usually purchase our clones).  Unless otherwise noted, the information for strains I DID NOT grow, comes from a combination of reviews found on [All Bud](https://www.allbud.com/marijuana-strains/indica-dominant-hybrid/point-break) and [Wikileaf](https://www.wikileaf.com/strain/point-break/).
