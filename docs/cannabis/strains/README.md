This is the strain README.

I currently reside where it's 100% legal.  During the lockdown of 2020, we decided to try growing our own.  I have to admit, I'm pretty lucky having an unlimited stock of marijuana.  

Since I like to grow and smoke cannabis I've started a journal of all the strains I come across and whether or not I liked them. Not all of the descriptions are my own wording, but the results section is the effect it had on me.
