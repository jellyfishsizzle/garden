## About

We didn't grow this one, so it required a little research (instead of straight from [Dark Heart Nursery](https://darkheartnursery.com/) where we usually purchase our clones).  This info came from a combination of reviews found on [All Bud](https://www.allbud.com/marijuana-strains/indica-dominant-hybrid/point-break) and [Wikileaf](https://www.wikileaf.com/strain/point-break/).

Point Break is a slightly indica dominant hybrid strain (60% indica/40% sativa) created through crossing the delicious Tropicana Cookies X Trophy Wife strains. Named for the famous film, Point Break packs a lifting and full-bodied high that will have you feeling energized before helping you settle down and get to sleep.
