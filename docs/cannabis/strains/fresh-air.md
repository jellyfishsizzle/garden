## About

Fresh Air beat out 100 other strains in a blind taste test, and it’s easy to see how; Purple Caper’s cross of Chocolate Kush x Cantaloupe offers the best of both the sativa and indica worlds. This exotic hybrid has a compact flowering structure and dense nugs and is an extremely versatile grower, given that this pheno was hunted through indoor (hydro and soil), greenhouse, and outdoor trials to test its resilience. With flowering in 9 weeks and superior resistance to mold and insects, Fresh Air will thrive in all grow environments, producing colorful, eye-catching buds. This cut has a very unique menthol nose, laced with fruity notes. It has a buzzing body and cerebral effect, and exceptional flavor all along the way.
