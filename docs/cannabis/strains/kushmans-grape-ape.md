## About

This is one of breeder Kyle Kushman’s[^1] personal picks. A fruit snack-flavored indica, this unique cross of Afghani x Mendo Purps x Skunk #1 is a testament to the legacy of old school purple strains. It grows like a true indica, forming a short, squat bush with very short nodal spacing that flower in 8 weeks; yields can be increased with environmental stressors, making it ideal for indoor environments. This strain produces dark green and rich purple flowers that have a candied grape and berry scent. Patients and connoisseurs alike love this strain for its layered cerebral and body effects that provide an exceptional relaxing experience with stellar sweet taste.
