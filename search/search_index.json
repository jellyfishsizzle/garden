I've had ideas for a blog and website for a long time but never did much about it because I felt like I couldn't find the bits of technology that would comprise the site I envisioned. I wanted a blog, a wiki, and a little eye candy but none of the technologies I knew could do it. After various failed attempts with quite a few options, it occurred to me that the answer might not be a single technology, but a \"network\" of technologies (plants) within a single domain (garden). 1 While looking for some technical information I stumbled across Nikita Voloboev's site and then The Blue Book . I realized this is exactly what I wanted and there was a name for it! The more I poked around the more excited I got about the technology that built it. I was already well on my way with a previous website running on Jekyll and GitHub Pages but I just couldn't figure out how to get the notes aspect incorporated. Ironically, I did give Gitbook a try previously, but didn't actually consider using them together, rather than one or the other. Yes, I know this isn't new technology, but parts of it are new to me. More about the technology below. What's a \"digital garden\" exactly? First, let's think about what an actual garden is. Generally, gardens have these qualities: It's usually a place things grow A garden is never really \"done\" Weeds can take over if left unattended (See the enormous gap in my blog posts) A garden can be very personal and private or shared with the public They require attention and love It can be a great place for reflection and contemplation There is no right or wrong way to do it This last part is the key. I am doing this for me and I can do it any way I like. Do you see how this can all be applied to the digital world? Basically what I'm saying is, that this isn't a blog or wiki or website, it's all of them (or none of them?). This is a place to grow ideas and share information. Pretty clich\u00e9, but I feel like it can truly be anything I want it to be, my imagination is the only limit. I'm not totally sold on GitBook, mostly because I want to be able to use footnotes (why not?) and I can't do that here. All of the other beautiful gardens I have come across were put together by folks that know what they are doing. For now, this is how we're going to roll. Not too easy on the eyes, but functional and low overhead. I guess that'll do for now. Who knew how important the technology would be? I spent quite a bit of time trying out different ways to create my garden in a the way I wanted it to look. It turns out, it's like most other things in life, there is always a different way to do it. But I still struggled to make it what I envisioned. After searching for a way to make my Gitbook not look like crap, I came back to The Blue Book . Not only did I like it, there was instructions and words of encouragement on how to get it all set up! So, after a week on Gitbook, this is the new and improved look. As I'm quickly finding, this will always be a work in progress. I'm looking forward to keeping it up. I have a habit of changing hobbies often and I'm hoping this one sticks. Keep in mind this is my brain (and opinion), exposed for anyone to explore. Be gentle. Well, this is it, this is my digital garden. Who would've thought I'd be a gardener one day? ... I did garden when I was a kid... Seems I just hadn't found any other digital gardens yet! \u21a9","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"emojis/","text":"Fun fact, the I forked to create this site had a page with some emojis and thought I'd create my own.

I'm a security enthusiast, sysadmin, veteran, father, husband, and all around geek. A jack of all trades (and master of none). Q3. What is the answer to life, the universe and everything? 42. Q4. Don't you have anything better to do with your time? What is a better use of my time other than giving my unwanted opinion? Q5. How often will there be a new post? When the mood strikes me. Q6. How long should you wait to go into the water after you've eaten? At least 30 minutes. Q7. What kind of music do you like? Depends on my mood and who I'm with. Pretty much anything but country. Q8. What's wrong with country music? So many things. I've tried to like it. I've worked with people that listen to nothing but country. It's just not my thing. Q9. Why is the sky blue? Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. Q10. What is the definition of a will? A dead giveaway. Q11. How much Red Bull can someone drink and not die? According to Caffiene Calculator I can drink 170 cans and still be safe. Although, I'd probably be pretty sick. Q12. Is there a map of the internet? The Carna botnet was comprised of 420,000 devices created by an anonymous researcher to measure the extent of the Internet in what the creator called the \u201cInternet Census of 2012\u201d. More details about how it went down and the resulting map can be found on Wikipedia Q13. Cats or dogs? Cats. Q14. Where is the best place to go for a vacation? My current favorite destination is Japan. However, that is subject to change since I haven't been everywhere yet. Q15. What time is it? Check out the NIST Official Official Map. If you are outside the US, you're out of luck. According to the page \"The .gov means it\u2019s official.\" Q16. If milk goes bad if not refrigerated, why does it not go bad inside the cow? It won't go bad per se, but if a cow is not milked regularly, it can eventually stop production. Q17. Are you an expert on cows? No. Q18. What about cats? Not really. Q19. Why is this place called \"Cat Elevator\"? One day I was picking up my cat and the name just came to me. Seemed like a good fit.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"cannabis/","text":"Cannabis README","title":"Cannabis"},{"location":"cannabis/strains/","text":"Strain Catalogue \u2691 README for the strain catalogue.

I got it mostly for fun as cyber security has always been a passion of mine. In fact, I had big dreams of one day doing it for a living. But first let\u2019s go back.. The year was 1998, I was in the US Navy and was living in San Diego, CA. My friend, who was also in the Navy (and later went to Captian\u2019s Mast for obtaining his Commanding Officer\u2019s email password), got me hooked. We spent every chance we had to geek out. Whether it was learning Linux, looking for hardware for \u201cthe next big thing\", or attending 2600 meetings and DEFCON. 1 Fast forward to when security was just becoming a thing. There were exactly two other people in the large company I worked for that were responsible for security. One of whom I knew fairly well. He often explained how security was \u201cboring\u201d and what his day-to-day work was like. That guy is a CISO somewhere now. Despite what I knew and coming from another company where I was almost solely responsible for their security, I feel like this was pivotal to my moving away from the unknown(?) InfoSec path to the more comfortable path of making a sysadmin my career, especially at a time of having a family to support. About 15 years later, my teenage son and his friends were taking high school and college-level computer science classes and I got the bug again. Not only that, but the wealth of information and tools had come a LONG way in the last 15 years haha This pretty much sums up my security background. Somewhat relevant history of the internet \u21a9","title":"Security"},{"location":"tech/security/VPN/","text":"Didn't think you need a VPN? Here's one more reason you do. Today, while everyone is protesting their freedoms being taken away by the government for telling them to stay home so they don't die, more privacy gets taken away.. for realz . Today the Senate voted to allow the FBI to look at your web browsing history without a warrant. That's right, people are protesting the government trying to keep them safe, yet this story barely hit the news. The government just got even more power to spy on your internet habits as millions of people stay quarantined at home. The US Senate voted down an amendment to the US Patriot Act that would create a tougher standard for government investigators to collect the web search and browsing histories of people in the United States. Should law-abiding people have to worry about the government looking over their shoulders the entire time you are online? That\u2019s exactly what the government has the power to do without this amendment. ISPs are already in a position to see a lot of what you do online since all of your traffic goes through their servers. This means that preventing ISP tracking online is a lot harder than just using a third-party browser add-on or browse in incognito or private mode. Your ISP can do anything they want with your data. Not only can they sell your data or use it to sell you more things, they can give it to the government without requiring a warrant. Get a VPN!

Basically, any information that can legally be gathered from free, public sources about an individual or organization. Usually, that means information found on the internet. Technically anything that is public information falls into the category of OSINT. Think about that for a minute. It's not just books or reports in a public library, it's also articles in a newspaper, or statements in a press release. You're probably thinking, \"So what? I don't have to worry about anything like that.\" A lot of people these days don't, but what about these: Facebook Twitter Instagram Reddit Other various online forums Why should I care? \u2691 Identity theft Password/creds theft Stalking/physical location What do I do now? \u2691 It's never too late! Here are a few things you can do with very little effort to protect yourself from common forms of identity theft: Put a freeze on your credit for the big three credit organizations: Equifax Transunion Experian Unless you are someone that frequently requires having your credit history checked (like buying cars or getting new credit cards), it's pretty much a set it and forget it type thing. On the rare occasion, you need to have your credit checked, it's just a matter of flipping the switch on their app or website. A little bit of time and effort now beats the potential sadness and hassle later down the road. Use a password manager like 1password or onepass Personally, I use 1Password and yes, I use the cloud version. I'm probably going to against some people's opinions and say your passwords or credit card numbers are far more secure in their encrypted storage that is also encrypted end to end than keeping it locally. But I think at some point, you HAVE to trust someone with your important data, especially passwords. I currently have 378 passwords and secure notes in my account. There is no possible way I could remember every single one unless I just used the same one everywhere. Why is it bad to have a weak password? \u2691 Obviously, using the same password for everything is a very dangerous thing to do. You're probably thinking, \"I don't care if someone finds my Netflix account, nobody cares what I'm watching.\" But what if Netflix was compromised ? Think about the things that Netflix knows about you.. Username Password Credit Card Programming choices Email address Home/billing address Now, what could someone do with THIS data? Would any of these things be used by your other accounts like Amazon or bank account or other financial accounts? You have to think like a hacker. If your Netflix data (that is now PUBLIC) contains the name of a pet or a relative, maybe they could guess other bits of data. For example, if my compromised Netflix password is scruffy89 and maybe my Amazon account password is also the same, then they would have complete control of your Amazon account including purchase history and a LOT more personal data. Well, my password isn't EXACTLY the same, I increment the number at the end! Even still it would only take a few guesses if it was scruffy88 or scruffy95. Worse yet, if it were scruffy1995, it'd be easy to guess 1995 was a significant year. Could it be part of your other passwords or maybe even a security code for something else? See where this can go? All because someone at Netflix made a mistake. Right? Well.. In some cases, it's not directly the fault of the company that is supposed to be protecting your data, it could be a third party or contractor. Regardless of who is to blame, this day and age there are a lot more people that have access to your data than you realize.
