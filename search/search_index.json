I've had ideas for a blog and website for a long time but never did much about it because I felt like I couldn't find the bits of technology that would comprise the site I envisioned. I wanted a blog, a wiki, and a little eye candy but none of the technologies I knew could do it. After various failed attempts with quite a few options, it occurred to me that the answer might not be a single technology, but a \"network\" of ideas (seeds) and technologies (plants) within a single domain (garden). While looking for some technical information I stumbled across Nikita Voloboev's site and then The Blue Book . I realized this is exactly what I wanted and there was a name for it! The more I poked around the more excited I got about the technology that built it. I was already well on my way with a previous website running on Jekyll and GitHub Pages but I just couldn't figure out how to get the notes aspect incorporated. I did give Gitbook a try previously, but didn't consider using them together, rather than one or the other. Yes, I know this isn't new technology, but parts of it are new to me. More about the technology below. What's a \"digital garden\" exactly? First, let's think about what an actual garden is. Generally, gardens have these qualities: It's usually a place things grow A garden is never really \"done\" Weeds can take over if left unattended (See the enormous gap in my blog posts) A garden can be very personal and private or shared with the public They require attention and love It can be a great place for reflection and contemplation There is no right or wrong way to do it This last part is the key. I am doing this for me and I can do it any way I like. Do you see how this can all be applied to the digital world? Basically what I'm saying is, that this isn't a blog or wiki or website, it's all of them (or none of them?). This is a place to grow ideas and share information. Pretty clich\u00e9, but I feel like it can truly be anything I want it to be, my imagination is the only limit. I'm not totally sold on GitBook, mostly because I want to be able to use footnotes (why not?) and I can't do that here. All of the other beautiful gardens I have come across were put together by folks that know what they are doing. For now, this is how we're going to roll. Not too easy on the eyes, but functional and low overhead. I guess that'll do for now. Who knew how important the technology would be? I spent quite a bit of time trying out different ways to create my garden in the way I wanted it to look. It turns out, it's like most other things in life, there is always a different way to do it. But I still struggled to make it what I envisioned. After searching for a way to make my Gitbook not look like crap, I came back to The Blue Book . Not only did I like it, there are instructions and words of encouragement on how to get it all set up! So, after a week on Gitbook, this is the new and improved look. As I'm quickly finding, this will always be a work in progress. I'm looking forward to keeping it up. I have a habit of changing hobbies often and I'm hoping this one sticks. Keep in mind this is my brain (and opinion), exposed for anyone to explore. Be gentle. Well, this is it, this is my digital garden. Who would've thought I'd be a gardener one day? ... I did garden when I was a kid...","title":"README"},{"location":"about/","text":"This page is a deeper dive into who my intended audience is. It's probably not very clear who this is for and that seems to vary from day to day. Sometimes I want to have a big following and get feedback, whether it's upvotes or comments, or something similar. However, I always want it to be for me. I want this garden to be my operating manual for when I am either unable to remember something or when I am awakened after some kind of reboot. 1 I have a lot to say and nowhere to say it. Facebook steals your data and does terrible things with it. I went so far as to completely delete my account from Facebook back in 2017. I\u2019m not a fan of Insta, Twitter, Snapchat, or pretty much any other social media. Reddit is my go-to for many things these days, but it\u2019s not the appropriate place for a blog and I\u2019m too lazy to have multiple accounts to keep things more anonymous there. So here we are. Just a blank slate with plenty of space and lots of things I want to say. No \u201cfriends\u201d, likes, dislikes, or funny captions. 2 I might never allow comments, and I haven't decided who I will share this site's connection with me.

I suspect I'm going to have to put things in categories at some point or it will get out of hand quickly. This is a work in progress. Q00. Why does this FAQ require you to hit refresh again to see the answers? Because I don't know enough JavaScript to fix it. I already spent way too long on getting the look I had in mind, so I'm not ready to abandon it just yet. Don't worry, I'll get around to it in all my copious spare time\u2122. In the meantime, both visitors to this garden will have to refresh the page twice before the answers will be visible. This is probably the most first world problem I can think of. If this bothers anyone you can file a ticket with our support team. 1 Q01. Do you really need an FAQ page? No, but I love FAQs! Also, the Introduction doesn't cover everything. Q02. Who are you? I'm a security enthusiast, sysadmin, veteran, father, husband, tinkerer, and all around geek. A jack of all trades (and master of none). Q03. What is the answer to life, the universe and everything? 42. 2 Q04. Don't you have anything better to do with your time? What is a better use of my time other than giving my unwanted opinion? Q05. How often will there be a new post? When the mood strikes me. Q06. How long should you wait to go into the water after you've eaten? At least 30 minutes. Q07. What kind of music do you like? Depends on my mood and who I'm with. Pretty much anything but country. Q08. What's wrong with country music? So many things. I've tried to like it and I've worked with people that listen to nothing but country. It's just not my thing. Q09. Why is the sky blue? Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. Q10. What is the definition of a will? A dead giveaway. Q11. How much Red Bull can someone drink and not die? According to Caffiene Calculator I can drink 170 cans and still be safe. Although, I'd probably be pretty sick. Q12. Is there a map of the internet? The Carna botnet was comprised of 420,000 devices created by an anonymous researcher to measure the extent of the Internet in what the creator called the \u201cInternet Census of 2012\u201d. More details about how it went down and the resulting map can be found on Wikipedia Q13. Cats or dogs? Cats. 3 Q14. Where is the best place to go for a vacation? My current favorite destination is Japan. 4 Q15. What time is it? Check out the NIST Official Official Map. If you are outside the US, you're out of luck. According to the page \"The .gov means it\u2019s official.\" Q16. If milk goes bad if not refrigerated, why does it not go bad inside the cow? It won't go bad per se, but if a cow is not milked regularly, it can eventually stop production. Q17. Are you an expert on cows? No. Q18. What about cats? Not really. Q19. Why is this place called \"Cat Elevator\"? One day I was picking up my cat and the name just came to me. Seemed like a good fit. Q20. I skipped the intro , what is a digital garden? For now, you'll have to rely on the intro. I might write more about it later\u2122. Q21. How do I create my own digital garden? This is the place to start. Alternatively, you can fork my repo and tinker. Q22. Who is the intended audience of your \"garden\"? I am. I was going to add more to that sentence but then realized, it's me. Then I realized, I need an about page. Q23. Why do you double space after a period? I learned to type on a teletype machine in the Navy. A teletype message had to have two spaces after a sentence for it to be clear enough to read. Now it's just 30 years of muscle memory. Q24. Do you have a disclaimer? Why, yes I do. Q25. Where is the chat feature? This site is cobbled together in my spare time and hosted on GitHub. If you would like a chat feature, feel free to file a feature request with our support team 5 . Q26. Why don't footnote links work in the FAQ? It's a markdown/html issue.

Music-related things will go here.","title":"Music"},{"location":"music/go-go/","text":"Growing up just outside of Washington DC, I was exposed to the music that came from the area known as \"Go-Go\". Seeing shows live was an unbelievable experience and go-go was a big part of my life as a teen. Just imagine a stage (or a house party) full of nothing but percussion instruments and a few horns. No drum machines, just drums of various sizes and shapes, a few horns and a lot of interaction with the audience. Go-Go is not a spectator sport! There is a lot of call and response, a lot of cowbell, and a lot of dancing! Since I left the DC area when I was a teen, 1 some of the information here is memories, music I have, and research around the web. Wikipedia has a much different explanation of go-go and mentions a lot of bands that I'm either vaguely familiar with or just hadn't heard at all. While I agree Chuck Brown is known as \" The Godfather of Go-Go \", go-go is a musical movement that cannot be traced back to one single person. The rest of the article is odd that it mentions big concert venues and songs making an impact on the music charts when that wasn't my experience at all. When I lived in the DC area growing up there were a few big shows 2 , the best you had was going to live parties or very small venues where the only way to get a recording of the music was a live \"PA\" tape. 3 During DC's initial surge, the Department of Parks and Recreation even drove bands around in \u201cShowmobiles,\u201d allowing groups to perform free go-go concerts in multiple neighborhoods during the summer months. 4 There is really no way to accurately describe the sound of go-go music, so the best thing to do is just listen for yourself. Here are few of my favorite songs that I found on YouTube. Take Me Out to See Junkyard - The iconic \"Hee-Haw Song\" by Junkyard Band Physical Wunders 1996 - Another of my fav bands Junkyard Band - Live and direct - Gives you an idea what live shows were like in a venue ChillyWillie and High Performance Band Live is a good example of a typical show and distinct sound Northeast Groovers - (NSFW language) - One of my fav Go-Go bands A long time ago. In a land far, far away. \u21a9 For example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Go_Live_at_the_Capital_Centre \u21a9 A \"PA tape\" is exactly what it sounds like. Someone would leave a cassette tape recorder beside a mic and record the music \u21a9 The local's version of the history of Go-go \u21a9","title":"Metasploitable2 with docker"},{"location":"music/pink-floyd/","text":"You don't need to be high to enjoy Pink Floyd, you need Pink Floyd to enjoy being high.

Here's one more reason you do. Today, while everyone is protesting their freedoms being taken away by the government for telling them to stay home so they don't die, more privacy gets taken away.. for realz . Today the Senate voted to allow the FBI to look at your web browsing history without a warrant. That's right, people are protesting the government trying to keep them safe, yet this story barely hit the news. The government just got even more power to spy on your internet habits as millions of people stay quarantined at home. The US Senate voted down an amendment to the US Patriot Act that would create a tougher standard for government investigators to collect the web search and browsing histories of people in the United States. Should law-abiding people have to worry about the government looking over their shoulders the entire time you are online? That\u2019s exactly what the government has the power to do without this amendment. ISPs are already in a position to see a lot of what you do online since all of your traffic goes through their servers. This means that preventing ISP tracking online is a lot harder than just using a third-party browser add-on or browse in incognito or private mode. Your ISP can do anything they want with your data. Not only can they sell your data or use it to sell you more things, they can give it to the government without requiring a warrant. Get a VPN!

Many years ago, in a previous life, I was really into computer (in)security. A friend of mine helped me with my first Slackware install and despite that I still enjoyed it. I got into going to 2600 meetings, regularly went to DEFCON and was totally hooked. This is it for me, this is what I want to be when I grow up. As time went on I found myself with a sysadmin gig where working in security seemed like it would be pretty boring. This was at a time where companies were just understanding the web wasn't a safe and trusting place. Ideas like risk management and acceptable use policies were what people worked on. Many companies didn't appreciate they would need pen testers to help protect them. Fast forward to the year 2020. People now get paid insane amounts of money for \"hacking\". There are people that look for vulnerabilities in code and/or networks and even certifications to show one has the ability to do it (or at least took a class on it). Not only can you get paid to be a hacker, but also many of those jobs let you work from anywhere on the planet. What I've found most surprising is all of the tools and the resources that are just a few keystrokes away. A family friend turned me on to the OverTheWire site that gives you challenges that call for various computer skills. From the site, you start out with a basic login for a host that contains the puzzles. Moving forward, you get the account for the next level by solving the puzzle on the current level. Each puzzle gets increasingly more difficult starting with just being able to log in and higher levels include things like setting up public/private keys for ssh finding local exploits and privilege escalation. Later, I came across Hack The Box that was even more advanced. Once you manage to get an invite (by solving a short challenge) they provide you with VPN access to their entire network that contains a number of vulnerable hosts for you to hone your pentesting skills. It's extremely organized and well designed with a leaderboard. Best of all, it's free! Both sites are completely free. I couldn't imagine having these resources when I was growing up. What a difference it would have made if I had the chance to hack into other computers with no risk of trouble from the law or anyone else! We've come a long way from hanging out on the BBS on our 2400 baud modems screaming, \"Don't pick up the phone!!

Everyone was about spreading information, transparency, and people were excited to share everything. Things were going great. There was sharing and getting anything they could get their hands on digitized! Keep in mind, the Internet is a new place and that data isn\u2019t going to get there on it\u2019s own. New content was being added to the Internet wherever possible, some intended for public consumption, some not. But this Internet thing is really starting to take off, I can put anything here and I can share with everyone! Fast forward to the 1990s. Internet access was first offered commercially, and the world clamored to get on the \u201cinformation superhighway\". This is really where we start to go off the rails. You didn\u2019t need to be at a major university or company that can afford computers the size of rooms to get on the Internet anymore. People could get online, albeit rather slowly, and start getting emails, browsing the World Wide Web, and relishing in the information age. Now everyone can get on the web. Great, right? Not exactly. As with most things in life, someone seems to come along and fuck up a good thing. The Internet was no exception, but this was going to change everything. Not only was everything shared, but it was also shared for everyone. As more and more people got online, it was a race to keep the things people really wanted private, just that.

I was curious to see what Wikipedia had to say about the matter. As it turns out, there are a lot more references to hacking than I realized. At the time of this writing 1 it says Security hacker is what we want. It has some information about the subculture , the history , and even the explanation of different \"classifications\" 2 of hackers. Seems easy enough, right? Well, there is also a note on the Security hacker entry that says \"Not to be confused with Hacker or Hacker culture \". If you follow the first link you will find all of the same information spun a different way, with slightly different names. I guess everyone really does have their own definition of what a hacker is. One of my favorite tshirts has this definition of \"hack\" on the back: hack (h\u0103k) A clever, non-obvious solution to an interesting problem. An appropriate application of ingenuity to creatively overcome an obstacle or a limitation. The technical equivalent of chewing gum and duct tape. In the end, I believe a \"hacker\" is more broad of a term. As in, someone that has above average skills, usually with technology. Whether it is phones, computers, or other hardware or software. Sure, anyone can operate an iPhone. But can you jailbreak it, and customize it with your own look and feel? I would consider those skills above and beyond and therefore, a hacker. April 2022. \u21a9 \"White hat\" vs \"black hat\". I think the distinction between white hat and black hat is a little cringey and in most circles, considered media jargon. In my opinion, these days the difference really comes down to a paycheck and motive.

This means I completed a course to learn that I can (in some cases) hack 1 other servers in a controlled environment. Offensive Security is the company that offers certifications for various level of difficulty, but OSCP is the golden standard for getting your foot in the door to the cyber security field. The certification process is pretty vigorous, at super high level: Pay money to Offensive Security They give you study materials, access to the private practice labs, and 1 exam Study, Study, Study and bonus points for actually completing all the materials 2 Take 24 hour long, proctored exam where you have exploit 5 vulnerable servers The following 24 hours are for completing the report complete with screenshots Submit the exam and wait for the results I got it mostly for fun, as cyber security has always been a passion of mine.

My friend, who was also in the Navy (and later went to [Captian\u2019s Mast] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment#Mast ) for obtaining his Commanding Officer\u2019s email password), got me hooked. We spent every chance we had to geek out. Whether it was learning Linux, looking for hardware for \u201cthe next big thing\", or attending 2600 meetings and DEFCON . Fast forward to when security was just becoming a thing. 3 There were exactly two other people in the large company I worked for that were responsible for security. One of whom I knew fairly well. He often explained how security was \u201cboring\u201d and what his day-to-day work was like. That guy is a CISO somewhere now. Despite what I knew and coming from another company where I was almost solely responsible for their security, I feel like this was pivotal to my moving away from the unknown(?) InfoSec path to the more comfortable path of making a sysadmin my career, especially at a time of having a family to support. About 15 years later, my teenage son and his friends were taking high school and college-level computer science classes and they gave me the bug again.

It's not often enough to keep committed to memory and I figured this might help other people as well. So let's look at some examples of local port forwarding and remote port forwarding as well as why we would need them. If you are in a hurry and just need something to jog your memory: ssh -L local_port:remote_address:remote_port username@remote_server.com <- Local ssh -R remote_port:local_address:local_port username@remote_server.com <- Remote Local Port Forwarding \u2691 \u201cLocal port forwarding\u201d allows you to access resources that aren\u2019t exposed to the Internet (or other networks). For example, if you want to access a web server at your office from your home and for security reasons, that server is only configured to accept connections from the local office network. If you have access to an SSH server at the office, and that SSH server allows connections from outside the office network, then you can connect to that SSH server from home and access the web server as if you were sitting in the office. To use local port forwarding, connect to the SSH server normally, but also supply the -L argument. The syntax is: ssh -L local_port:remote_address:remote_port username@server.com If you're still following along with the example, assume the following is true: * The web server at your office is located at 192.168.1.111 on port 8080. * You have access to the office\u2019s SSH server at ssh.youroffice.com. * Your user account on the SSH server is \"bob\". In that case, your command would look like this: ssh -L 8080:192.168.1.111:8080 bob@ssh.youroffice.com At this point, you\u2019d be able to access the webserver on port 8080 at localhost. You could just plug in http://localhost:8080 to your web browser and browse the web server as if you were in the office. All traffic sent to port 8080 on your host will be tunneled to 192.168.1.111:8080 on your office network. Pretty handy for working at home! Remote Port Forwarding \u2691 \u201cRemote port forwarding\u201d is the opposite of local forwarding, and isn\u2019t used as often. It allows you to make a resource on your local host available to a remote host. For example, let's say you\u2019re running a web server on the local PC you\u2019re sitting in front of. But your host is behind a firewall that doesn\u2019t allow incoming traffic. To use remote forwarding, use the ssh command with the -R argument. The syntax is largely the same as with local forwarding. Note the LOCAL address of your host is used this time: ssh -R remote_port:local_address:local_port username@server.com Now we assume the following: * Your web application listening on port 8080 on your local host. * The SSH server at your office is ssh.youroffice.com. * Your user account on the SSH server is bob. You\u2019d run the following command: ssh -R 8888:localhost:1234 bob@ssh.youroffice.com Someone could then connect to the SSH server at port 8080 and that connection would be tunneled to the server application running on port 8080 on the local host you established the connection from.

I'll probably make another post about some of the other steps I took later\u2122. For now, I wanted to do a quick walkthrough of setting up 2FA for SSH with Google Authenticator . This guide was done for an Ubuntu-based host, but can be done with just about any flavor of Linux. If you aren't using 2FA for EVERYTHING you possibly can, you are doing yourself a disservice with the number of data breaches rising, some highlighting the weakness in SMS-based 2FA. You can find a list of sites that support 2FA and in many cases, how to tell other sites they should support it. It's also a good idea to use ssh keys if you aren't already. This post makes some assumptions; That you are familiar with how to edit files in a terminal, and you know what SSH and two-factor authentication is. I'm also assuming you already have your favorite authenticator app. Lastly, the usual warning about doing things at your own risk applies. If you're not careful you can lock yourself out of your host and you will be sad. There are only a few steps, read them all BEFORE you start, you've been warned! 1. Install Packages \u2691 $ sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator 2. Configure SSH Server (with sudo/root access) \u2691 Open /etc/pam.d/sshd with your favorite text editor (vim) and add the following line: auth required pam_google_authenticator.so Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and set this line to yes to enable use of the Authenticator we added to the pam configuration. # Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes NOTE: DO NOT RESTART SSHD YET! 3. Set up Google Authenticator \u2691 With the package we installed in step 1, we now have a binary that allows us to configure the Google Authenticator. $ google-authenticator Read the options presented and decide what suits your needs. Selecting yes to each question is a good option. Make note of the backup codes somewhere safe. This will allow you to log into your ssh server if you don't have your app. Do you want authentication tokens to be time-based (y/n) y Do you want me to update your \"/home/user/.google_authenticator\" file? (y/n) y Do you want to disallow multiple uses of the same authentication token? This restricts you to one login about every 30s, but it increases your chances to notice or even preventing man-in-the-middle attacks (y/n) y By default, a new token is generated every 30 seconds by the mobile app. In order to compensate for possible time skew between the client and the server, we allow an extra token before and after the current time. This allows for a time skew of up to 30 seconds between authentication server and client. If you experience problems with poor time synchronization, you can increase the window from its default size of 3 permitted codes (one previous code, the current code, the next code) to 17 permitted codes (the 8 previous codes, the current code, and the 8 next codes). This will permit for a time skew of up to 4 minutes between client and server. Do you want to do so? (y/n) y If the computer that you are logging into isn't hardened against brute-force login attempts, you can enable rate-limiting for the authentication module. By default, this limits attackers to no more than 3 login attempts every 30s. Do you want to enable rate-limiting? (y/n) y 4. Add the key to your Google Authenticator App \u2691 There are many other authenticator apps aside from Google's to pick from so I'll leave it up to you to configure. I use Authy for iOS and it's pretty straightforward to set it up with the QR code from above. 5. Restart the SSH service \u2691 Now comes the moment of truth because restarting sshd will likely log out your current session (if you are logged in remotely with SSH). $ sudo service sshd restart 6. Test your access \u2691 You should now be prompted for the code as well as the usual password. If you are using keys to access your host, you will still have access using the key and won't be prompted for the code. The 2FA code has been configured to only apply to the password-based authentication. Fret not! If you have already configured ssh keys (as you should!) and want to test out your 2FA, it's pretty simple: $ ssh -o PasswordAuthentication=yes -o PubkeyAuthentication=no user@host.com Password: Verification code: Now you can rest easier knowing that even if your credentials are somehow compromised, your host will still require 2FA!","title":"2FA SSH with Google Authenticator"},{"location":"tech/security/ssh2fa/#1-install-packages","text":"$ sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator","title":"1.

It's really helpful to see key things you are looking for in the output of a command at a glance. Sure, the output is the same, but it makes it easier to see what you are looking for. There are some examples of what it looks like below. Keep in mind I can change any of the colors, what commands use color, and what things are highlighted myself. I'm not sure how I lived without this. NOTE: The instructions below assume you already have python installed and that you are fairly comfortable with the command line. Let's go over the setup and general usage so that you can give it a try and also so I can remember how it's done later down the road. It's all in python, so it can be used pretty much anywhere. I'm currently using it on MacOS and Linux. First, we'll need the actual source code. I forked a copy for my own use so that I can keep copies of configs and share them across multiple machines. The repo is here . With the source code cloned, it's just a matter of running the included install script. NOTE: You'll need to use sudo if you go with the defaults in the install script. There is a section that outlines installation that has some useful information. Basically, you run the install script and it will copy all of the bits to a reasonable place (obviously, you can change it to meet your needs). The only trick is if you are using bash it doesn't put the config in the right place by default. I'll tweak it in all my copious spare time. You're probably wondering why I wrote anything about this when there is already plenty of information on installation and usage in the readme. Well, there is some customization I've done that I found useful to keep note of. I'll go over the \"easy\" way and then the way I did it so that all the configs are in one place and it will stay updated for other hosts. The easy way \u2691 Change to the grc directory you cloned and run sudo install.sh The conf.bashrc file wasn't copied to the location it is expected to be found. Yes, I'll probably update the install script later. For now, if you use bash, just copy grc.bashrc to /etc. For bash users add this to your ~/.bashrc : [[ -s \"/etc/grc.bashrc\" ]] && source /etc/grc.bashrc (For zsh it would be ~/.zshrc and source /etc/grc.zsh) Source your rc file or launch a new terminal and run commands that you would expect to have colored output. The git way \u2691 Instead of running the install script we'll just create a bunch of sym links to point to your config files in your repo so that you can check in new and updated configs to your own repo. For this example I'll use ~/src/rc as the location of my project. sudo ln -s /etc/grc.bashrc ~/src/grc/grc.bashrc sudo ln -s /etc/grc.conf ~/src/grc/grc.conf sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/grc ~/grc/colourfiles For bash users add this to your ~/.bashrc : [[ -s \"/etc/grc.bashrc\" ]] && source /etc/grc.bashrc (For zsh it would be ~/.zshrc and source /etc/grc.zsh) Source your rc file or launch a new terminal and run commands that you would expect to have colored output. A few notes about customizations \u2691 The included readme contains all the information you'll need to start making customizations and adding new commands you want color for. There were a few things not so obvious to me: There needs to be a conf file for each app you want to have colored output. The config file for each app is in /usr/local/share/grc . This is where colors are defined for specific output you want colored. For each conf file in /usr/local/share/grc , there needs to be an alias for it in your grc.bashrc (or grc.zshrc). For each conf file, you have to create a corresponding entry in /etc/grc.conf with the name of the config file and regex to identify the command.
